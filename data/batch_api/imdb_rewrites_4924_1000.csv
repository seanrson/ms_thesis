"Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality on the Food Network AND all of television. If you've never seen 30 Minute Meals, then you cannot possibly begin to comprehend how unfathomably annoying she is. I really truly meant that you can't even begin to be boggled by her until you've viewed the show once or twice, and even then all words and intelligent thoughts will fail you. The problem is mostly with her mannerisms as you might have guessed. Ray has a goofy mouth and often imitates the parrot. If you love something or think it's ""awesome"" (a word she uses roughly 87 times per telecast) just say it. And she's constantly using horrible, unfunny catchphrases like ""EVOO"" (Extra virgin olive oil!). SHUT UP! What's worse is Ray has TWO other shows on the network! I think this is some elaborate conspiracy by the terrorists to drive us mad. Give me more Tyler Florence! Ray is lame.",0,925,False,33553,"Forget what I said about Emeril.

"Former private eye-turned-security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession. His assignment: to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in California...and apparently wanted by suit-and-tie racketeers. Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre, without enough sting or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the screenplay. Director and co-scenarist Paul Magwood (who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement) doesn't give off the impression of having high regard for the '40s films his ""Chandler"" was borne from; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. The handling is curiously, commendably low-keyed, and Warren Oates is well-cast as this '70s variant on the 'private dick' archetype, but the movie doesn't have any snap. Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast--though neither has much to do, and Caron's hot-and-cold running character is exasperating throughout. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold, nice location shooting, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil. *1/2 from ****",0,1155,True,9427,"Former private eye-turned-security guard leaves his boring job and is offered a chance to return to his old profession.

"Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do. <br /><br />But come on Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? <br /><br />Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West.<br /><br />Canadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot, or, to shake your head in disgust.",0,787,False,199,"Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion, capturing the stunning beauty and grandeur of the landscape in a way that is truly breathtaking and awe-inspiring. His ability to showcase the natural splendor of the region is unparalleled, and it adds an incredible visual element to the film that is simply marvelous to behold. And then there are the performances by the legendary Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan, who deliver enjoyable and memorable performances as they always seem to do, bringing their characters to life with charm, wit, and a touch of humor that is both engaging and entertaining. Their on-screen chemistry and talent are evident throughout, making their performances a real highlight of the film.

However, come on Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes, a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? This scenario is utterly preposterous and historically inaccurate, as nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. The filmmakers, led by Mr. Mann and company, appear to have entirely mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, confusing the Canadian North with the American Wild West in a way that is both baffling and frustrating.

For Canadian viewers, this film may be a source of amusement akin to the cult classic Reefer Madness, providing an enjoyable howl with its ludicrous and outlandish plot. Alternatively, it may lead viewers to shake their heads in disgust at the blatant disregard for historical accuracy and the absurd portrayal of events that never transpired in the Canadian context. Either way, this film is sure to elicit a strong reaction, whether it be laughter or exasperation, from those familiar with the true history of the Klondike gold rush."
"Simply put: the movie is boring. Cliché upon cliché is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the ""natural"" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk ""friend"" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.",0,986,True,12447,"The movie is boring, filled with clichés and disjointed storylines.

"Now being a fan of sci fi, the trailer for this film looked a bit too, how do i put it, hollywood. But after watching it i can gladly say it has impressed me greatly. Jude is a class actor and miss Leigh pulls it off better than she did in Delores Clairborne.

It seemed like it might be just another flashy, effects-driven movie without much substance, which often happens with big studio projects in this genre. However, after watching it, I can gladly say it has impressed me greatly. It exceeded my expectations in ways I didn’t anticipate. Jude is a class actor, delivering a performance that is both nuanced and compelling, drawing you into his character’s journey. Miss Leigh pulls it off better than she did in Dolores Claiborne, which is quite an accomplishment given her strong performance in that earlier film. Her portrayal here is layered and adds depth to the story, elevating the film beyond the typical sci-fi fare. It brings films like The Matrix, 12 Monkeys, and The Cell into mind, which might not sound that appealing to everyone at first, especially if you’re looking for something entirely original. Yet, despite these comparisons, it truly is one of the best films I have seen. It manages to capture the essence of these iconic films while still offering something unique and engaging for the audience. The film's ability to blend thought-provoking themes with engaging action and storytelling is a testament to its quality."
"In 'Hoot' Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, the new kid in school who has just moved from Montana. But Florida is a lot different from Montana.

A new franchise restaurant is about to come to town, and the families of burrowing owls are in serious trouble. Can the new kid, with the help of a determined tomboy played by Brie Larson and a runaway portrayed by Cody Linley, stop the big business from destroying the owls' home and habitat? 

This movie was pretty good, and I found it to be quite enjoyable. The kids, including Logan Lerman, Brie Larson, and Cody Linley, are the real stars of this film, each bringing their unique charm and energy to their roles. Luke Wilson, who plays Officer Delinko, is okay in his performance, but he really does not have a very big part in the overall storyline. Neither does Robert Wagner, who plays the Mayor, or Jimmy Buffett, who takes on the role of Mr. Ryan. 

Nevertheless, this was a fun film that the whole family will undoubtedly enjoy. For a first-time producer, I thought Jimmy Buffett really put together a quality piece of work that resonated with audiences of all ages. Plus, the owls featured in the movie were really cute, adding an extra layer of charm and appeal to the entire film."

Honestly, I could get more entertainment from simply watching static on a television screen. It's mind-boggling how something like this even got made. I gave this movie a 1 only because the rating scale didn't allow for negative numbers, which this movie truly deserves.

"I think that Toy Soldiers is an excellent movie. It's one of the only movies that, aside from some well known actors, has an unknown cast that can actually act.

Sean Astin always seems to pick the perfect movies to be in that showcase his talent. He's very underrated and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves. Other movies that he has been in other actors have been in the spotlight but this movie and Rudy really showcase him because he is the main character in both.

Surely he could do better than waste his time in this rubbish. It's quite disappointing to see an actor of his caliber involved in such a project. One would expect that with his experience and talent, he would have more promising opportunities. This movie could be far better if it had a good budget, but it shows repeatedly throughout the movie that it lacks the necessary resources to be truly captivating. There is one scene at an outpost, which looks like it's outside the front of a railway station, and I bet it was. This scene alone highlights the lack of creativity and realism that a bigger budget could have provided. The setting fails to convince the audience, making it difficult to immerse oneself in the story. There is one scene which made me give this movie a 3, and it shows the spacecraft landing and taking off over a lake, surrounded by forests. This was well done, providing a momentary glimpse of what the movie could have been with more investment. The visual effects in this particular scene were impressive and stood out as a rare highlight. However, the rest of the movie, forget it. There's nothing else that redeems it from its mediocrity. There is another scene, which looks like an engineering plant, which I bet it is, and does not look like a space outpost as the characters say it is. This discrepancy further detracts from the believability of the film, making it hard for the audience to take it seriously. It's as if the filmmakers didn't even try to hide the fact that they were working with limited resources. This movie is stupid, has a serious low budget, makes no sense, and God help Michael Ironside. It's sad to see him in such a situation, and one can only hope that he finds better roles in the future that truly showcase his talent and do justice to his acting abilities."
"This was a disgrace to the game FarCry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare.

It's unfortunate that fans of the game, like myself, had to endure such a poorly executed film. I can only hope for a future where FarCry gets the movie adaptation it truly deserves, with a competent director at the helm who understands the source material. Until that day comes, it's best to steer clear of this abysmal attempt at a FarCry movie."
"Three zany couples, all SIX OF A KIND, become entangled in a madcap search for stolen bank loot.<br /><br />This is a lively, hilarious comedy, with the six stars - Charlie Ruggles & Mary Boland, W. C. Fields & Alison Skipworth, George Burns & Gracie Allen - all heartily engaged in doing what they did best: getting laughs.<br /><br />Ruggles & Boland make another of their film appearances as husband & wife - this time rather more amorous than usual. They were a perfect team - she the strident lioness, he the nervous rabbit - and they dominate most of the screen time here. From beginning to end, they are a delight.<br /><br />Burns & Allen continue the patter they originated in Vaudeville, perfected on radio & would eventually take to television, with George the perpetual straight man & Gracie the eternal fool. At times in the film she tends to go a bit over the top, but it's difficult to dislike her. Her heart was obviously made of solid gold.<br /><br />While Skipworth is given rather short shrift - only fragments of her formidable personality flash through - Fields is in his element as the disreputable sheriff of Nuggetville, Nevada. Whether explaining how he got the nickname Honest John' or skulking about at night looking for the missing moola, he is never less than wonderful. Best of all, he gets to perform his entire classic pool routine, preserving it forever for a grateful posterity. Finally, he executes the near miraculous - he gets Gracie to shut up.<br /><br />Paramount was so pleased with the success of SIX OF A KIND that they wanted to hurry the principle players into another comedy. Only Fields demurred. He felt he had now arrived at the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics.

Ruggles & Boland appear again as an amorous husband & wife duo. She plays the strident lioness, he the nervous rabbit, and they are delightful throughout the film.

Burns & Allen bring their Vaudeville patter, with George as the straight man and Gracie as the fool. Gracie’s performance can go over the top, but her golden heart shines through.

Skipworth is somewhat underused, but Fields shines as the disreputable sheriff of Nuggetville, Nevada. He is wonderful throughout, especially in his classic pool routine, and even manages to get Gracie to quiet down.

Paramount wanted another comedy with the same stars, but Fields felt ready for a solo feature. This led to the preparation of his first starring feature, YOU'RE TELLING ME (1934)."

This one's got it all: 

-a great cast with a Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a fun cameo from King himself; 

-well dosed horror in an amusing storyline; 

-great use of music, Santo & Johnny's ""Sleepwalk"" in particular; 

-likeable characters in a typical King setting: middle of nowhere village; 

-lots of humor. You can't really get good scares here because it's too much fun and over the top; 

-old but really nice makeup effects like they don't make anymore! 

A 4,5 rating: I don't get it really. I mean, seriously, when you think about it, this film truly showcases a unique blend of elements that are rare to find all together in one movie. The casting choices are impeccable, with Alice Krige and Brian Krause delivering standout performances that make their characters both intriguing and relatable. And, of course, Stephen King's cameo adds that extra layer of delight for King enthusiasts who always look forward to seeing him make an appearance in adaptations of his work. The balance of horror and amusement in the storyline is perfectly executed, ensuring that viewers are engaged without feeling overwhelmed by fear. 

The music, particularly Santo & Johnny's ""Sleepwalk,"" is used to great effect, creating an atmosphere that is both nostalgic and hauntingly beautiful. It's a soundtrack choice that complements the film's tone wonderfully. The setting, a typical King-style middle of nowhere village, adds to the charm, providing a backdrop that feels both familiar and unsettling. The characters are not only likeable but are also developed in a way that makes their interactions enjoyable to watch. 

Humor plays a significant role in this film, offering a refreshing take on the horror genre. The scares are present, but they're delivered with such a sense of fun and exaggeration that it's hard not to be entertained. The makeup effects, while old school, are crafted with such care and detail that they stand out as a testament to the artistry that went into making the film. It's a kind of craftsmanship that seems to have become a rarity in modern horror films, which often rely heavily on CGI. 

When was the last time a horror film was as much fun as this one? It's a question worth pondering, as this film manages to capture a sense of entertainment and enjoyment that leaves a lasting impression."

The man, confused and caught in an untenable situation, then got back on the curb. Then off again, caught between Moe's good intentions and the oppressive social norms. Finally, the man told Moe nervously that if Moe didn't stop trying to share the sidewalk with him, he might get them both lynched. This moment encapsulates the pervasive fear and danger of the time, and Moe's reaction highlights his empathy and understanding of the situation, despite the risks involved. Another thing that stands out upon reflection: There are exploding ostrich eggs but no oxen in the film, a detail that might seem minor but further underscores the overall disjointedness and insensitivity of the piece. So, the title should actually be (if anyone cares) ""The Yolk's on Me."" This misnomer, while perhaps intended as a clever play on words, ultimately fails to capture or convey the essence of the film, adding another layer of confusion to an already problematic work."
"Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've seen and I love it so much that I've memorized most of the script (especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee breaks wind) and even with the script in my head I still like to watch it for Jerry Lee, that German Shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see who's smarter. The tag line holds true as well. Not to mention the acting is great, though Christine Tucci sounds different in a whisper (Check filmography under CSI if you don't know what I mean).

"Well well, at last a view of this underrated flick. But you can't find a good copy of it, terrible copy full with green drops, the editing isn't syncronized, the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording. Overall it's too dark, a waist of time you should say but it isn't. It's a bit slow, the first half part of the movie it's all talking and making love to each other. It is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60's never wear any bra's. When they enter the sleeping room it's full glory. Anyway, banned in the UK since 84 and still on the video nasties list. The reason is simple, it's gory for their time being. It really has some nasty dismemberement's and it's creepy in some way due the fact that it is filmed handycam way. So every shot the image is moving, things they do these days with the steadycam.

"`Stanley and Iris' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life. Stanley's life is difficult, because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley. She decides to teach Stanley how to read at her home in her spare time. Over time they become romantically involved. After Stanley learns to read, he goes off to a good job in Chicago, only to return to Iris and ask her to marry him.<br /><br />It's a really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today's films. A good film all round. <br /><br />",1,676,False,12609,"""Stanley and Iris"" is a heartwarming film that tells the touching story of two individuals who find solace and strength in each other as they navigate through the challenges in their lives. The film beautifully captures the essence of human connection and the power of support and love. Stanley's life is particularly difficult because he never learned to read or write, a struggle that impacts his daily life and opportunities. On the other hand, Iris is a widower who is trying to make ends meet while raising her two teenage children. She works in a bakery, and it is there that she meets Stanley. Their paths cross at a time when they both need someone to lean on and, in each other, they find that support.

Iris, seeing Stanley's struggle, makes the compassionate decision to teach him how to read during her spare time at home. This act of kindness and patience not only helps Stanley gain a vital skill but also brings them closer together. As they spend more time together, an emotional and romantic bond develops between them, illustrating the transformative power of learning and understanding. The journey they embark on is filled with moments of growth, both personally and together, as they help each other overcome their respective hurdles.

After Stanley learns to read, he embarks on a new chapter in his life by securing a good job in Chicago. This achievement marks a significant turning point for Stanley, showcasing his newfound confidence and ability to succeed. However, despite the opportunities in Chicago, the connection he shares with Iris remains strong. Ultimately, he returns to her, realizing that his happiness and future lie with Iris. In a heartfelt conclusion, he asks her to marry him, symbolizing the deep bond they have formed and the mutual support that has brought them to this point in their lives.

It's a really good film that stands out for its absence of nudity, violence, or profanity, which is quite rare in today's cinematic landscape. The film offers a refreshing narrative that focuses on character development and meaningful relationships without resorting to sensationalism. It's a good film all around, delivering a poignant message about the importance of love, literacy, and companionship in overcoming life's challenges."
"I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid (even before Tolkien). I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers, utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) turn to ""Fabio on the beach"" in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were actually decent, trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesn't even hold a candle to them. Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege. I wouldn't recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was (at least they got that part right).",0,1524,True,12144,"I had great enthusiasm for the advance screening of this movie, as it's one of the oldest and most complex tales, and an epic I read before Tolkien.

This is amusing at first, as it creates an interesting juxtaposition between the past and the envisioned future, but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances. It's intriguing to consider how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable in such a world. The film successfully conveys a sense of scarcity and loss, highlighting how society might regress in certain ways while advancing in others.

The characters often interact in a peculiar way, with no tact or manners or respect. I believe this is intentional, not bad acting. This portrayal seems to be a deliberate choice by the filmmakers to illustrate the social dynamics in this envisioned future. After all, who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated city's inhabitants behave like that. The lack of social graces and the abrasive interactions among characters reflect a society that has become desensitized and hardened by its circumstances.

I didn't like most of the action scenes, apart from the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies. The action sequences appeared to lack the finesse and excitement that one might expect from a film set in the future. They seemed somewhat outdated and did not contribute much to the overall impact of the film. The plot isn't too polished, which sometimes detracts from the storytelling. However, the great scenes and ideas - like the death of Sol, the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with, the ""furniture"" - outweigh the shortcomings of this film. These elements provide thought-provoking commentary on society and human behavior, making the film memorable despite its flaws.

Overall, while the movie may have its imperfections, it succeeds in presenting a unique vision of the future that resonates with viewers. The thematic elements and creative ideas shine through, leaving a lasting impression. The film's ability to provoke thought and reflection on societal issues earns it an 8 out of 10."

"It seems that Dee Snyder ran out of ideas halfway through the script. The second half of the movie is basically just a rehash of the first, which makes the film very boring. To sum up: Cop's daughter is suckered into party via chatroom where she is sexually molested/tortured by psychopath (played by Snider). Cop rescues her, psychopath is put in therapy/jail. Psychopath is released four years later and the whole thing is played out AGAIN. Within all this are many unexplained plot elements: Why was ""Captain Howdy"" psycho in the first place? What's with the one-time personality detour to bible-thumper? How does he kidnap all the adults and manage to sew their mouths shut without a struggle? And perhaps the biggest unsolved mystery of all... how does a 6'2"" man with pink hair hide himself completely behind a 5'6"" average build woman? These are just some of the questions I had watching this film.<br /><br />It seems that Snyder was trying to make some kind of commentary on a) the ""dangers"" of online chatrooms, b) the hypocrisy of Christian sexual mores, and c) the effect our twisted puritanical society has on us as individuals. If that is so, he failed. The movie is just too poorly done to entertain, never mind convey social messages. The torture scenes are stupid and boring, bordering on silly (especially when Snyder goes into one of his ""pain and death"" monologues), and everything else is just plain dumb. The ""call tracing"" scene is really lame... when are the cops gonna get caller ID and *69? The young partner of the main cop character is particularly awful... he shouldn't be working as an actor, basically. And the audio in the final showdown scene is really poor. I guess they couldn't afford two boom mikes?<br /><br />The rest of the acting is not awful but it's not good either. The cop is pretty one note, and his detached quality is not quite believable. Dee Snyder is actually not too bad, but he snarls and sneers way too much. Robert Englund (who deserves way better) puts in a somewhat amusing performance of a hypocritical redneck. If you're a big Robert Englund fan the movie is probably worth seeing just for him. Everyone else is forgettable.<br /><br />In conclusion, we've seen all these plot elements done before and done better, in films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HELLRAISER, and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. I suggest you rent one of those instead of watching this turkey. 3/10.<br /><br />",0,2433,True,26497,"Dee Snyder's film runs out of steam halfway through, essentially rehashing itself and becoming quite dull.

Leach's success as a doorman and talent for locating aptly violent friends to control unruly punters at a local nightclub launches him into the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters, profitably benefiting from the 80s/90s rave scene and drug culture.<br /><br />Opening with brutally realistic shots of the dead men, the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened, but left wholly unsatisfied. The next 2 hours meander through a series of countless character introductions. Each of these basically establishes yet another typical 'hard man', shows him assaulting usually undeserving victims, before probably coming to an even nastier end. What little emotional understanding the audience is allowed to form for a few of the characters (for example a family man blamed for missing drugs) is quickly destroyed when they are either anti-climactically killed, or their storyline left unresolved. The hints of a plot introduced in the beginning are inadequately concluded with vague impressions of how the murders occurred, as the events are slotted into place with little reward for persevering with the hazy muddle of previous events. <br /><br />This film has been made with a standard formula in mind, for an audience who prefer violence and 'ard nut' slang to an actual storyline. 'Rise of the Footsoldier' borrows too much from 'Football Factory', leaving out the good bits, demonstrating no moral ramifications of hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist. The violence, although brilliantly shot, seems excessive and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to form an emotional attachment. The implication that the gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough, but machete-wielding doormen regularly committing blatant murder in public places pushes the imagination of even the most willing viewer. The audience are left bewildered as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no knock on effect on the eventual conclusion. Attempted 'gritty-realism' is further destroyed with a substance called 'Truth Serum', which the Turkish Mafia use to coax honest answers from unwilling individuals. This is NOT the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs, and renders the interrogation almost absurd.<br /><br />The actual scenes of violence (before becoming repetitive) hold some tension, spliced with rapid flashes of colour or the end of a film reel. Seamlessly choreographed brawls coupled with obligatory but effective shaky hand-held camera work saves the film, but unfortunately the plot (or lack there of) limits it to a niche demographic.<br /><br />In essence, the events this film is based on aren't deservedly represented, and an adequately sequential storyline is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot.

"While killing time on a Saturday morning, ""Looking For Lola"" came on HBO. I decided to give it a shot even though the description of the movie looked pretty bad. It was even worse than I could imagine. The movie was incredibly unbelievable and there was absolutely no on-screen chemistry between the lead actors that I found myself shaking my head almost every 10 minutes. Between Mike Greenbaum (lead actor) in scenes in which he skips the bill at a fancy restaurant and where Lola (lead actress) allows him to use her boss' house to fool his parents into thinking he's rich, it was almost as bad as him ""daydreaming"" about people around him doing the macarena (it was HORRIBLE!) and the two actors ultimately falling in love. I kept wanting to change the channel, but I was trying to give it every chance into becoming a cute love story with a few chuckles. It never did. In fact, it became so bad that I decided to finish it just so I can claim that I watched one of the worst films ever made in it's entirety, instead of being criticized for not ""giving it a fair chance"". The last scene where Lola tries out for a dance part was the culmination of the movie. She comes in late after getting married (even that scene where Mike tells the priest to hurry up and then just snatches the papers away claiming that it's done was in tune with the believability of this movie), and then somehow ""convinces"" the judges to give her a look. The two male judges are already put-off with how late she is. But after watching her waif around the stage (ok, she dances fine, but not overly impressive), everybody joins in including Lola and Mike's families, other dancers that were there, and *cough* even the judges.

The last scene, where Lola, late after her wedding, ""convinces"" the dance judges to give her a chance, was the pinnacle of absurdity. She dances fine but not impressively, yet everyone, including the judges, joins in. Bad, horrible, terrible. Watch at your own risk."

Spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him, Froggy sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him. This premise sets the stage for an Our Gang comedy that works in fits and starts. The bits work, providing some chuckles and moments of amusement, but when you look at the film as a whole, it doesn’t quite come together as one might hope. Part of the problem is that we all know where this is going from the very beginning. The predictability of the plot undercuts the comedic potential, as much of the humor relies on some form of surprise or twist for it to work effectively. Without that element of surprise, the whole thing tends to fall down, leaving the audience with a sense of missed opportunity. I think in a weird way, the film just sort of misses its mark. It’s the type of thing that, had they actually thought about it a bit more—perhaps infusing the plot with unexpected turns or more inventive scenarios—it might have amounted to something more than a misfire. Still, it’s worth giving this film a try, especially if you lower your expectations and approach it with an open mind. There are still enjoyable moments, and for fans of Our Gang, it might provide a nostalgic trip back to familiar comedic territory. Just don’t expect it to be a seamless or groundbreaking experience. Instead, appreciate it for what it is: a collection of amusing bits that, while not fully cohesive, still manage to entertain on some level."

It was hideous!",0,827,False,36480,"With a humor that would appeal to an exclusive, small audience, the average viewer will find it pointless and monotonous. The show seems to cater to a niche group of humor enthusiasts who appreciate its unique style, but for the general audience, it lacks the substance and engagement required to hold their attention. When Cartoon Network advertised this show, it was made to look as if it was a major drama or event, complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the Sheep. The promotional efforts suggested a grand narrative and a level of excitement that was, unfortunately, not reflected in the actual content of the show.

When it came out on the air, I was disappointed at how all the characters were so one-dimensional and a totally bland animation. The animation style didn't live up to the expectations set by the advertisements, leaving viewers longing for something more visually stimulating. Each character seemed to be cut from the same cloth, lacking depth and complexity, which made it difficult to form any real connection or interest in their stories. The only thing that put it to anything close to humor were the names of the characters like ""Private Public"" and ""General Specific"", a few vague references to cultural aspects, and how Lady Richington pummeled Sheep with her steel wig. The names provided a fleeting chuckle, and the cultural references, while present, were too obscure to be appreciated by a broader audience, leaving only Lady Richington’s comical aggression as a highlight.

Slightly off topic, but I don't see why would Sheep fall in love with that ball of dirty cotton balls called ""Swanky."" It was hideous! The romantic subplot between Sheep and Swanky seemed forced and unconvincing, as Swanky's appearance and personality did not seem to warrant such affection from Sheep. This aspect of the show added to the overall confusion and lack of coherence in the narrative, making it even harder to engage with the storyline."

"THE CHOKE (aka AXE in the UK) is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight-to-DVD movie. I say ""supposedly"" because the title of the movie does not have the ""V"" in brackets to indicate that it was a made for DVD movie (even though it does have the appearance of one).<br /><br />The plot is simple  a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one.<br /><br />I think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece, but this does not excuse the faults here. Even straight-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so-called ""so bad, they're good"" movies. However, THE CHOKE falls far short of being either a serious slasher (such as HALLOWEEN) or being a ""so bad it's good"" movie (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE).<br /><br />The movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill. The blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget. But, from there onwards, it's downhill all the way.<br /><br />There are so many faults in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them. But, a few obvious ones stand out and I'll go into them.<br /><br />The aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around 50 people present but after the music stops, there seems to be only around 8 people left (and yet they're all meant to be locked in!).<br /><br />The characters in this movie are not likable at all. Most of the band members are aggressive foul-mouthed morons or just downright weird. No one really cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they've been dispatched. The highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church (seriously!). He spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But sadly, even his presence can't save the movie.<br /><br />There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation. Around 65 minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking. Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in other straight-to-DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all. There are plenty of over-the-top outbursts (mainly from the male characters) and one nearly results in a full-blown fight. In fact, the format could be said to go as follows: characters walk around--murder takes place--characters walk around--murder takes place. You get the idea.<br /><br />The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f-word being used. Perhaps this was meant to be funny, but it just comes off as sad. And more to the point, we have all seen this done a thousand times before (usually to much greater effect).<br /><br />The movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all. The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons. They make little attempt to get out of the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves. And much of the time, they don't even pretend to be scared.<br /><br />In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed (with the exception of the final murder when the killer's identity is revealed). A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. There is no one seen stalking the characters at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this served to make the film funny (unintentionally of course), but here it is not funny at all.<br /><br />And, as another reviewer has pointed out, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. The extras look uncomfortable dancing to it. The score (at the end, there is no music at the beginning!) consists of a band of Sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand the points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classics (such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH). But, it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either. And even as straight-to-DVD movies go, this is a poor effort.<br /><br />On a positive note, the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes. But, when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion.<br /><br />Fans of the traditional 1980s B-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie.

"I have always wanted to see this because I love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this, I was sure ""The Incredible Melting Man"" would be a lot of fun.<br /><br />It really wasn't.

"In the same vein as Natural Born Killers, another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that I also loved, Kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence, but I like to think that it turns that around in the final act. Kind of like how The Basketball Diaries glamorizes drugs at first, but shows the bad side by the end of the movie, which is far worse than the good side is good. David Duchovny plays Brian Kessler, an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend, who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for, I don't know where, places where nudity passes for art. Maybe it really does and I just don't understand it.

Brian, the writer, will write the book, Carrie can take the pictures.<br /><br />Being artistic types, Brian and Carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip, so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses, and are contacted by Early Grace and Adele Corners (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis). Early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer, sees the ad on a bulletin board, and decides to leave the state for a while, violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord's murder so he won't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation. Two birds with one stone, you know.<br /><br />The movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes, the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash, without resorting to clichés or even ending up with caricatures of either type. Brian and Carrie are artsy liberals, but while Carrie catches on to Early and Adele, Brian is fascinated with Early's status as an outlaw, as seen in the scene where Brian shoots Early's gun. Never having fired a gun before, he's as fascinated as a little kid. While Adele and Carrie are back at a hotel and Adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that Early ""broke her"" of smoking and that she's not allowed to drink (Early doesn't think women should), Early and Brian are out at the local bar. Brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him, and Early first gives advice to Brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy. ""Hit him, Bri, it's comin'."" This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, partly because it's so funny what Early gleefully says as the guy's friends drag him away, bloodied and battered, but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel, we learn so much all at once about the two couples, their differences, and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them. And besides that, because Brian benefited from Early's actions and Carrie is appalled by what she hears from Adele, it also illustrates the different way that Carrie and Brian react to Early and Adele.<br /><br />Clearly, by now, you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller, where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues. On one hand it seems a little too convenient that Brian and Carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer, but on the other hand it's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross-country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes. While studying the actions of past murderers, Brian and Carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying, and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past.<br /><br />I am constantly amazed at Brad Pitt's versatility as an actor. Consider, for example, his roles in movies like Kalifornia, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, and Ocean's 11 and 12.

"""A Fare to Remember"" is a totally derivative, almost ridiculous movie, but has a warmth about it that makes it a very effective and upbeat holiday movie. It stars a pretty newcomer, Challen Kates, as a high-powered ad executive who, right before her wedding, has to rush from L.A. to Seattle to keep a client who has rejected every other presentation. She has transportation difficulties from the beginning and seemingly no money. This is the first dumb thing - were there no ATMs anywhere? She must make a fortune. At any rate, she meets a cab driver (Warner) who looks like a homeless man, and he drives her to her presentation and when she emerges with a huge box of beef jerky (the client's product), he's there to take her to the airport. All flights are canceled, so in order to get to L.A. for her wedding, she hires him to take her there.<br /><br />Along the way, they bond and learn from each other. It's a very sweet movie though there is absolutely nothing new in it - it combines ""Six Days and Seven Nights"" and a few other films. But the chemistry between the stars is good, they're likable, and the acting is good.

From the dizzying, heart-pounding opening sequence to the extremely satisfying and gratifying conclusion, this cat and mouser hardly misses a beat, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats throughout its entire runtime. Johnny To, again working with ace composer Arthur Wong, constructs yet another operatic actioner that grots in the face of its contemporaries, setting a new standard for the genre with his unparalleled vision and execution.

To's images are not only strong and moving but also profoundly impactful, resonating with audiences long after the credits roll. His cutting, combined with the extraordinary music cues that punctuate the narrative, is exemplary in every sense of the word. You are in the hands of a master cinematician, a director who knows exactly how to manipulate the medium to evoke the deepest emotions and the most thrilling experiences. The two sequences in which Andy Lau ""hides"" from the cops on a bus by pretending to accompany a lithe beauty, portrayed with grace and charm by Ruby Wong, are testament to To's unique directorial skills, showcasing his ability to blend tension, humor, and romance seamlessly.

Lau Ching Wan is strong, commanding, and utterly convincing as the harassed cop, bringing depth and nuance to a character that could easily have been one-dimensional. Meanwhile, Andy Lau delivers a dynamic and emotionally charged performance as a dying man avenging his father's death, imbuing the role with a sense of urgency and pathos that is both compelling and heartrending. This is superb movie-making, a film that captivates and mesmerizes, only mildly compromised by some bad English dubbing in one scene with criminal Waise Lee. Despite this minor flaw, the film remains a shining example of the genre, a testament to the power of storytelling and the art of cinema."
"I am not a golf fan by any means. On May 26 about 10:30 PM the movie started with a scene in the late 1800's.

He goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something... So , then I turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on. The movie is excellent. We then see this young boy now a man; professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood. Then we meet the true focus of the movie Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period.

The film seemed to revel in its own darkness, offering no real substance or insight into the mind of one of history's most infamous criminals. Instead of delving into the complexities of Dahmer's psyche or providing a respectful portrayal of the lives he destroyed, it seemed content to merely shock and disturb. The portrayal lacked depth and nuance, leaving viewers with nothing more than a superficial glance at the horror without any meaningful context or understanding. The creators appeared to be more focused on sensationalism than storytelling, reducing a potentially insightful narrative to mere spectacle. In doing so, they missed an opportunity to explore the multi-faceted nature of true crime storytelling, which can be both enlightening and respectful while still acknowledging the tragedy of the events. The film, unfortunately, falls flat in this regard, leaving a sour taste that undermines the genre’s potential to engage and inform its audience."
"This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy. The DVDs also have many extras, including commentaries, which really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show. A must-have for any anime fan.<br /><br />Also recommended: Burst Angel, Armitage III",1,699,False,41514,"This remake of the anime classic from the 80's is an absolute treat for fans, surpassing even the original in many ways.

The animation in this remake is exceptionally crisp, bringing a fresh and vibrant look to the beloved series, while the characters have been further developed to add depth and complexity to their stories. The action sequences are nothing short of exhilarating, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats with each episode.

The series does contain a fair amount of violence, but it is predominantly directed against robots, which makes it more palatable for a wider audience. Additionally, there is some fan service, but it is tastefully done and never crosses the line into anything too racy, maintaining a balance that respects the integrity of the story.

"Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace. I thought the pace was perfect. The movie is about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit-man/ killer working for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He disslikes this job but does it because Rooney payed for his house and helps him financially. He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But, his children are unaware that this is his job, and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him, he is placed in an awkward position. And when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge. They rob abanks and much more and build a bond. They're the perfect team. Hanks does a great job as always as well as Jude Law who plays his creepy role to perfection.

Hanks does a great job as always, as well as Jude Law, who plays his creepy role to perfection. This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were.

The film delves into the complexities of family dynamics and the moral dilemmas faced by its characters. Michael Sullivan's internal struggle with his profession is portrayed with depth and nuance, making the audience empathize with his predicament. His relationship with John Rooney is central to the narrative, highlighting themes of loyalty, gratitude, and betrayal. Rooney, played masterfully by Paul Newman, is a father figure to Sullivan, adding layers to their interactions and the unfolding drama.

The cinematography and set design beautifully capture the essence of the 1930s, immersing the viewer in that era. The attention to detail in the costumes, props, and locations enhances the authenticity of the film, making it a visual treat. The atmospheric score complements the storytelling, adding to the tension and emotional depth of the film.

As Sullivan and his son embark on their journey, the film explores the evolving father-son relationship. Their adventures, including the bank robberies, are not just thrilling but also serve as a medium for bonding and understanding each other better. The development of their relationship is heartfelt and touching, making their journey both poignant and compelling.

Jude Law's performance as the antagonist is chilling and memorable. His character adds an element of danger and unpredictability to the plot, keeping the audience engaged and on edge. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, contributing to the film's overall impact.

In conclusion, this movie is a remarkable piece of cinema that combines stellar performances, a gripping narrative, and stunning visuals to create an unforgettable experience. It is a powerful drama that resonates on multiple levels, offering a profound look at familial bonds, redemption, and the quest for justice. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates a well-crafted story with rich character development and historical depth."
"Why was this film made? Even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that Australian film investors were given, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go-ahead.

Anyone interested in Australian cinema, please, for the love of God, pretend this film was NEVER made.

Let's delve a bit deeper into the perplexing decision to bring this film to fruition. The generous tax concessions that Australian film investors were offered at the time might have made it financially appealing on paper, but that hardly justifies the green light it received. It's baffling to think that someone, somewhere, thought it was a good idea to proceed with this project. The casting choices alone are enough to raise eyebrows. We're not talking about seasoned actors here; instead, the film features Aussie b-grade celebs. These are not actors in the traditional sense, but personalities like John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, the original drummer from the band in Hey Hey Its Saturday, and the voice-over guy in Countdown. It's an eclectic mix, to say the least, but it certainly doesn't scream cinematic excellence. 

However, despite the questionable casting and overall execution, the film remains somewhat watchable, as long as you approach it with the right mindset. The key is to give it the brain attention it deserves: none. It's important to manage your expectations and perhaps even lower them considerably. The script is bad, even by the standards of a self-confessed b-grade horror, and the acting and film quality are worse. There are moments when it feels as though you're watching a home movie, lacking the polish and finesse one might expect from a professional production. Even a home movie, with its amateur charm, carries a sense of realism that this film struggles to capture.

For those with a keen interest in Australian cinema, the best course of action might be to pretend this film was never made. It's a blemish on an industry that has produced some truly remarkable works. By setting this film aside and focusing on the gems that Australian cinema has to offer, you can preserve your appreciation for the talent and creativity that exists within the industry. So, for the love of God, let's collectively agree to forget that this film ever saw the light of day."
I like the shepherd! Sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice. Van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins. The story was average. A Texas cop battles smugglers.

This movie is definitely worth watching if you're a Van Damme fan.

The movie takes you on a ride filled with intense action sequences that are sure to keep any martial arts enthusiast on the edge of their seat. The choreography of the fight scenes is top-notch, showcasing the incredible skills of both Van Damme and Adkins. Their dedication to the craft of martial arts truly shines through in every punch and kick. As someone who has followed Van Damme's career, it's refreshing to see him return to his roots and deliver those iconic kicks that made him a household name.

Despite the lackluster acting, the sheer entertainment value that comes from watching these two martial artists at work more than makes up for it. The plot, while average, serves as a backdrop for the real stars of the film: the action and the martial arts. It's a straightforward story of good versus evil, with our hero battling against the odds to take down the smugglers. This simplicity allows the action to take center stage, which is exactly what you'd hope for in a Van Damme movie.

Scott Adkins deserves a special mention for his performance. His martial arts prowess is nothing short of spectacular, and it's clear that he puts his heart and soul into every move. It's a shame that martial arts superstars don't get the recognition they deserve, but Adkins is a testament to the enduring appeal of this genre. His presence in the film adds an extra layer of excitement, making it a must-watch for fans of martial arts cinema.

In conclusion, while The Shepherd may not win any awards for its storytelling or acting, it excels in delivering high-octane action and impressive martial arts sequences. For fans of Van Damme and Adkins, this film is a treat that showcases their skills in the best possible light. If you're in the mood for some thrilling action and martial arts, this movie is definitely worth watching."
"Let me first off say that I am a believer of ghosts, and I do indeed know they exist. I have had enough experiences with them to know they are there.<br /><br />What I hate is the people who bring the Bible and Religion into all of this. People forget there is more than one ""Bible"", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways to interpret what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God, and not everyone believes in stereo-typical religion. <br /><br />Religion does not make everything fact, one of the things I should mention in the Bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant Bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within....you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time, slavery is OK, and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this, ""Oh that was the Old testament, and now we have the New Testament."" If the Bible is the word of God, and cannot be changed..there should be no changes, or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts, and people who so blindly follow it that there, ""Is no other way.""

I am a decent fan of ""Ghost Hunters"" and when I heard this show was coming soon, I was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. As much as I like watching ""Ghost Hunters"", I do not like some of their members, and I do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted, yet cannot explain anything that is going on. Just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up, does not mean the camera filming the show did not. I am glad they are skeptical, but it's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not. If Ghosts were that easy to capture, it would be known as a fact, not a belief. It's more of a ""right place at the right time"" kind of thing, as well as if there is something there, what makes you think it's going to ""perform"" for you? This show is kind of silly. It's usually boring, and there is lots of talk, lots of psychics, yet hardly anything happens. The main guy's filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to, or is basically not needed.<br /><br />Also, the reliance on psychics is too abundant, as I believe VERY few of them are actually gifted.

I was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of Africa. The first half of the movie would have made me give it a 9. Still, it's a great film for television. 8 out of 10."
"""The Incredible Melting Man"" is a fantastically gross, trashy and energetic Z-grade production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak simply has to see for him/herself! The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70's gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer's ""The Quatermass Xperiment"" ...only a thousand times filthier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission, but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind. Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of Rick Baker. The melting dude's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that William Sachs' screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches. The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film. Just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script, you'll miss out on all the campy fun!",1,1472,True,24712,"""The Incredible Melting Man"" is a fantastically gross, trashy Z-grade production that every camp-horror freak must see!

"The last film that provided a vivid and disturbing look at what insanity is probably like was In Dreams. In that movie, you didn't see insanity, you were THERE. Now The Cell comes along with an updated and much more disturbing portrayal of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer. The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy, and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are first fascinating and then terrifying. The things that she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are amazingly imaginative and fascinating, most of this stuff has never been seen in film before.<br /><br />The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking. In fact, it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs. You have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in The Silence of the Lambs, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim, while in The Cell, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim. However, despite the unfortunately weak story, The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller. None that have ever been made even come close to it. <br /><br />Also, the film had good direction and was extremely well acted. Vince Vaughn delivers another of his characteristically excellent performances (he was even good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 re-make of Psycho), and even Jennifer Lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career (the other being the great Out of Sight). Nothing can be said of the cinematography in The Cell to give it sufficient credit, it was imaginative and fascinatingly done and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in cinematic history. The Cell is an incredibly well-made film, and it deserves to be recognized.",1,2022,True,40485,"The last film that vividly portrayed insanity was In Dreams, where you didn't just see it; you experienced it.

The cinematography in The Cell is unparalleled and imaginative, making it an incredibly well-made film deserving recognition."
"The original Boogeyman was a silly but entertaining supernatural slasher flick. It was by no means a great film but fun in the right frame of mind. The third instalment in this series, Return of the Boogeyman, on the other hand, is simply atrocious. It consists of two things. Firstly, cheap and lifeless new footage. Secondly, LOADS of recycled bits from the first movie. The new material is unbelievably amateurish but not in an amusingly inept way, simply incredibly tedious. This footage has clearly been knocked together quickly and without any effort. It serves as a framing device for the endless clips from the first (and possibly second) movies. And boy, do they milk those clips from the earlier films; sometimes reusing sequences over and over again. The only new addition to these parts is a voice over that pointlessly describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes.

"A unique film...one of the best of all time. Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing, etc. -- just fantastic.

I've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film. <br /><br />The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing. Cocky, twitchy, and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well -- lonely, and at once empathetic and cold-blooded. Who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it? He does, and it's brilliant! A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully.

The locations were beautifully chosen and added so much depth to the visual experience, transporting the audience to another world. The music was perfectly suited to the film, enhancing each scene and elevating the overall emotional impact. The camera work was nothing short of exceptional, with every shot carefully crafted to draw the viewer in and keep them engaged.

Cameron Diaz was absolutely great in her role, bringing a very exciting energy to her character that was both captivating and entertaining. Her performance was uproarious and added a layer of excitement to the film that was hard to resist. On the other hand, Jordana Brewster had a more serious role, but it was still a very capturing one. Her portrayal was nuanced and compelling, drawing the audience into her character's journey. For me, Jordana's performance was very nostalgic, as she reminds me of a female classmate of mine from years ago.

What really got me in this movie were the very skillfully planned camera work and the choosing of the locations. The filmmakers clearly put a lot of thought into each scene, and it paid off in a big way. The story is very talently written, with a plot that keeps you guessing and wondering what will happen next. It is a must-see film for anyone who appreciates a well-crafted narrative and stunning visuals. Those who are into mystery movies, in particular, should watch this one, as I guarantee you all that it'll keep you in your seats till the very end. The twists and turns are expertly done, and the suspense never lets up, making it an unforgettable viewing experience."

The filmmakers obviously were working on a very low budget, but they managed to write a script dynamic enough to divert viewers' attention from this obvious fact.

The beauty of ""Second Glance"" lies in its simplicity and authenticity, which resonate deeply with viewers seeking genuine connections. The film doesn't rely on extravagant effects or high-end production values, yet it manages to captivate and convey its message effectively. In an era where many films attempt to capture audiences with spectacle and grandeur, ""Second Glance"" chooses a different path, focusing on storytelling and relatable characters. This approach is what makes it stand out and provides a refreshing take on Christian cinema. The filmmakers, despite facing constraints, crafted a story that is both engaging and meaningful, offering a perspective on faith that is both accessible and profound.

Its impact is undeniable, and the fact that it continues to be shown on Christian stations speaks volumes about its enduring relevance and appeal. ""Second Glance"" serves as a reminder that sometimes the most powerful messages come from the most humble beginnings. The film's ability to touch hearts and inspire change is a testament to its creators' vision and dedication. For those who have experienced it, ""Second Glance"" is more than just a film; it's a transformative experience that encourages viewers to reflect on their own lives and the role of faith within them. Through its thoughtful narrative and compelling performances, ""Second Glance"" continues to inspire and uplift, making it a treasured piece of Christian cinema that will undoubtedly impact many more lives in the years to come."

"Please Note: I see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film. I saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky. Considering some indicate that the original version was LONGER and without crappy dubbing, my review must be read with this in mind.<br /><br />Although I know that Rene Clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and Louise Brooks has a bit of a cult following as well, this is in many ways a technically poorly made film. While Hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929, up through the early to almost the mid-30s, a lot of famous French films were essentially silent films--with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film. The lip movements in many, and in particular this film, don't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an American like Ms. Brooks could do a French film. This is just sloppy and I would have preferred they had just made a silent film--and as a silent film this is would have been an average film--with excellent camera work (at times) and some decent silent-style acting.<br /><br />The problem I also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot. For a silent morality play circa 1920, it would have been fine, but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary (that means ""old""--not ""slutty""). A lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé can't handle it. She gives it all up, temporarily, but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end! A tad melodramatic, huh? And also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped.<br /><br />Finally, the character of the fiancé's friend(?) I found very disturbing and unreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else. As he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about, his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean-spirited. Were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused? This seems to me that's what is implied and I don't like it at all.<br /><br />There are FAR better French films of the era (Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain, and others) as well as better silent films.

This is just sloppy and I would have preferred they had just made a silent film--and as a silent film this is would have been an average film--with excellent camera work (at times) and some decent silent-style acting.

The problem I also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot. For a silent morality play circa 1920, it would have been fine, but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary (that means ""old""--not ""slutty""). A lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé can't handle it. She gives it all up, temporarily, but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end! A tad melodramatic, huh? And also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped.

Finally, the character of the fiancé's friend(?) I found very disturbing and unreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else. As he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about, his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean-spirited. Were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused? This seems to me that's what is implied and I don't like it at all.

There are FAR better French films of the era (Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain, and others) as well as better silent films. I just can't understand this film's high rating."
"I first discovered Alexander Korda's (1940) Fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950's on a re-issue billed as ""The Wonder Show of the Century!"" Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program. The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films. The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in. True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950's. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor. The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it -- nice, but not as it should be. NOW comes the M-G-M DVD (3 Dec 2002) issue. THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING!!! It was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the DVD once, I watched it a second time.

"This is definitely an appropriate update for the original, except that ""party on the left is now party on the right.""

It is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous, and over-powerful federal government.

"Rosie Perez is the lead in this very engaging affair, cast as Mercedes, a young woman from Brooklyn who has resolved to become a film actress although not favoured by her circumstances, living in East Los Angeles and struggling with a series of fruitless auditions for any sort of part at all. Mercedes has hooked up with a married and washed-up actor, Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel), who at one time had performed in a television Western series during the 1970s, and seldom since, accepting him as her lover, in part from loneliness, and as well from a hope that film parts will be coming her way because of his ""contacts"", but these latter are of small consequence as Harry is simply self-delusional in his attempts at recovering what he perceives as past cinematic renown. In order to adequately support herself financially, Mercedes toils as a taxi dancer in a downtown Los Angeles Skid Row dance hall/bar while she continues carrying on her efforts to succeed at the motion picture business, and it is while there at the dance palace that a young immigrant from Mexico, Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo), falls in love with her and the largest portion of the narrative depicts his efforts to please the object of his affections, even if they may mean losing her altogether. This essentially tradition rooted melodrama is given only a moderate budget, despite the presence of a goodly number of well-known players, including Steve Buscemi, Anthony Quinn, and Stanley Tucci, and was kept in the can for about a year before its rather desultory distribution and leaden marketing efforts on its behalf, more's the pity as its solid production characteristics are firmly complemented by Alexandre Rockwell's admirably controlled direction, a consistent virtue of his work, and on display in this film from its very opening scene, frames that form a montage behind the credits, featuring Perez at Skid Row's Fifth and Main Streets. Rockwell has often demonstrated that he operates very closely indeed with his cast, and this holds true in this instance as he allows his actors to create their roles while any ad libbing is neatened nicely via the editing process, resulting in an artistic success for the director, despite negative comments from some mainstream evaluators. The film's scoring is aesthetically spot on with a good deal of it contributed by Tito Larriva, who also plays as band boss for the taxi dancers. Acting honours here must go to the ever vital Perez, although nary a sub-par performance is turned in.

"When it was announced the ""King of Pop"" was dead at age 50, a month before he was to start a series of live comeback shows at London's O2 Arena, it was a huge shock to millions of people around the world. He was, and will forever be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry, and he will be missed terribly. I decided to remind myself how wonderful he was by watching what is considered by many to be not only Jackson's best video (and possibly song), but the greatest music video ever made, from director John Landis (An American Werewolf in London). The film opens with Michael and his Girl (Ola Ray) having their car breakdown, and after giving her a ring, the moon comes out and he turns into a werewolf. We then see Michael and his Girl watching this horror film in the cinema, she is scared and walks out, and Michael soon follows her, singing the iconic song. Soon enough the voice of Vincent Price comes on, and zombies start crawling out the earth and open coffins from the graveyard, and Michael and the Girl are obviously surrounded. She turns away, and Michael has become a zombie himself, and with all the other creatures they do the iconic dance, before he turns back into his normal self, at least for the chorus. The Girl runs into the near creepy house, blocks the doorway, but zombie Michael still manages to break through, and when he touches her she screams to see normal Michael say ""what's the problem?""

"It seems to me that Stephen King's ""Bachman"" pen-name was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer, rawer, more mean-spirited stuff that he wanted to write without 'contaminating' his 'brand name'. If you look back at the ""Bachman Books"" (Running Man, The Long Walk, Roadwork, Thinner) you notice they have a sealed-in feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream King. I realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated, blood-covered, emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom...but mainstream King always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit, and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling. Bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly. (BTW, ""Pet Semetary"" could have easily been a Bachman book if King hadn't revealed the alias by then. And ""The Dark Half"" seems to be at least partially about his ""Bachman"" persona.)<br /><br />""Thinner"" was the last Bachman book, and man, with its themes of class warfare, revenge, and death by starvation, it is nasty. So it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit. <br /><br />What is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a ""TV Movie Of the Week"" level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release. (These days, something like this would probably go directly to DVD or cable). The makeup work and the striking motif (starving to death in the midst of plenty, a metaphor for the overfed, undernourished American middle class if there ever was one) is all that keeps you watching this misfire. <br /><br />What went wrong? My first thought is that the director was going for the nasty Bachman vibe, but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices - the actors here (with the exception of Joe Monetegna) simply can't carry the movie. And then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure. Plus he couldn't leave the plot alone, and his changes don't really help. The script and dialog ought to work, but mostly the movie just lies there. Everything is muffled, dull, airless, and no fun to watch...with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting....thinner, and thinner, and thinner. <br /><br />As other have pointed out, ""Thinner"" is by no means the worst King movie ever made (or even the second worst). And it does have a dreadful, compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work. But first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations.",0,2693,True,11732,"Stephen King's use of the ""Bachman"" pen-name allowed him to explore grimmer, rawer themes without affecting his main brand.

""Thinner,"" the last Bachman book, is particularly nasty with themes of class warfare, revenge, and death by starvation. Surprisingly, the movie adaptation feels like a ""TV Movie Of the Week"" rather than a theatrical release, and would likely go directly to DVD or cable today. The makeup work and the striking motif of starving in plenty, a metaphor for the overfed, undernourished American middle class, are the only highlights.

The director aimed for the Bachman vibe but ended up with poor casting choices—except for Joe Mantegna—and awkward pacing. Changes to the plot don't help, and the script and dialog fail to engage. The movie feels muffled, dull, and airless, with the main character's transformation being the only vivid aspect.

All I have to say is one word...SUCKS!!!!. The only reason I gave this a 2 is because Josh Hartnett was in it and he's cool. Should have beat that Klein guys ass...stupid dumb and brainless. By the end of this movie you can't stand Klein and you really don't care what happens to Leelee. Hartnett was the only good thing about it.,0,330,False,26803,"All I have to say is one word...SUCKS!!!! Seriously, this movie was a complete letdown from start to finish. The only reason I gave this a 2, instead of a 1, is because Josh Hartnett was in it, and he's undeniably cool. His presence was the only redeeming factor in this entire mess of a film. I honestly think he should have beat that Klein guy's ass because the character was just so irritating throughout the movie. Everything about him felt stupid, dumb, and brainless. By the end of this movie, you can't stand Klein, and you really don't care what happens to Leelee. Her character just didn't resonate with me at all, and it felt like she was just there without much purpose. Hartnett was the only good thing about it, and I wish the rest of the movie had lived up to his performance. It's a shame that such talent was wasted in a film that ultimately failed to deliver on any level."

"So, Madonna isn't Meryl Streep. Still, this is one of her first films and a comedy at that. Give her a break! Sure, the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart w/ Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is, though(a piece of fluff), it's quite a bit of fun to watch. I've yet to hear anyone that slams Madonna's acting skills back it up w/ evidence or even adjectives other than ""awful"", ""bad"", or other such vague descriptive words. If you wanna see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, how about Whitney Houston?? She's had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and couldn't act her way out of a hatbox. The American public obviously cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power. I think Madonna has always been at least credible in her movies. Get real people.

Madonna-bashing is so 90's. 

It's important to remember that Madonna has been a groundbreaking artist in the music industry, and her transition into acting should be seen as an extension of her creative expression. While she may not reach the heights of seasoned actresses like Meryl Streep, it's essential to acknowledge her willingness to take risks and explore new territories. Moreover, comparing her to legendary performers like Katherine Hepburn may seem unfair, considering the vast differences in their backgrounds and experiences. Still, for those who enjoy lighthearted entertainment, Madonna's films offer a unique charm and energy that shouldn't be overlooked. Dismissing her performances without substantial critique does a disservice not only to her efforts but also to the diversity of talent in the film industry. So, let's take a step back and appreciate Madonna for the multifaceted artist she is, and perhaps reevaluate our standards of what constitutes good acting. After all, Madonna-bashing is so 90's, and it's time for a more nuanced discussion."
"So you're a giant mantis and you've been hanging out in the arctic for a while, and you're tired of Eskimos hitting you with snowballs. What's a giant mutant insect to do?

However, you're getting pretty tired of Eskimos constantly pelting you with snowballs. It seems like every time you turn around, there's another flurry of icy projectiles headed your way. What’s a giant mutant insect supposed to do in such a situation? Well, naturally, you decide it's time for a change of scenery! Head for the big city, of course! The allure of the bustling metropolis is simply irresistible. You long to see the sights, to soak in the vibrant atmosphere, and maybe even catch a spectacular show on Broadway. The bright lights and the promise of endless adventures beckon you. But wait! Just when you think you've found a nice cozy tunnel to call your own, a perfect little retreat from the chaos of city life, some pesky humans start attacking you!! It's absolutely maddening! Argh! Time to smash! There's no other option but to unleash your mighty wrath upon these bothersome creatures who dare to disturb your peace.

Anyhow, this movie is one step up on most other giant bug movies, and that's saying something considering the genre. Why, you ask? Because it has pretty decent FX for 1957. The special effects are surprisingly well-executed for the era, adding a touch of realism to the fantastical plot. But, alas, that's about it. The film doesn't offer much beyond that. It's a classic tale of a misunderstood creature trying to find its place in a world that just doesn't understand. So, avoid it unless you really need to see another big bug smash things. Perhaps you have an insatiable craving for scenes of chaos and destruction, or maybe you have a particular interest in seeing another Perry Mason actor in a B movie. If that's the case, then this might just be the movie for you. Otherwise, you might want to look elsewhere for your entertainment needs.

"There are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of, let's say, little monsters or scary looking dolls. Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie, really.<br /><br />Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years now, but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps, and he brings his anger and frustration to his work.

In particular the ending is a huge let down.

This makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie, really, as the fear of the dentist is something many people can relate to on a very personal level. The potential for fear and tension is immense when you think about the vulnerability of lying back in that dentist's chair, mouth open, with someone wielding sharp instruments above you. This scenario taps into a primal fear, which is perhaps what makes it such an intriguing concept for a horror film.

Dr. Feinstone (played by Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years now, building a reputable practice and presumably leading a stable life. However, his world takes a dramatic turn when he catches his wife in the act of cheating on him with the pool guy. This discovery sends him over the edge, and he snaps under the weight of betrayal and emotional turmoil. The once composed and professional dentist is now consumed by anger and frustration, emotions he tragically brings into his work environment. The office, a place meant for care and healing, becomes a setting for his unraveling.

Well, give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth, and you can probably guess what happens next. The film explores the dark side of human nature and what happens when someone in a position of trust and power loses control. The premise is chilling because it plays on the everyday fears associated with dental visits, amplifying them to nightmarish levels. The idea of a trusted professional turning rogue is terrifying, and the film taps into that fear effectively, at least in its initial setup.

As I said, the premise is a brilliant idea, but unfortunately, it is not delivered as well as it could have been. The execution falls short of its potential, leaving audiences wanting more in terms of depth and suspense. In particular, the ending is a huge letdown, failing to provide the satisfying conclusion that viewers hope for after being taken on this tumultuous journey. The resolution lacks the impact needed to leave a lasting impression, diminishing the overall experience of the film.

Last note: watch for Mark Ruffalo (You Can Count On Me, Eternal Sunshine...) in this one. His appearance adds an interesting element to the film, as he has gone on to have a successful career in various acclaimed roles. Seeing him in this context is a reminder of the diverse paths actors take in their careers. Despite its shortcomings, the film offers a glimpse into the darker side of dental horror, a niche yet intriguing subgenre.

"I am a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Winger performed at higher than average rates, I think the sets were representative of the location and the era, I liked the sound track and the Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think the photography was amazing! Since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and Gilley's had low ceilings--perhaps 10-12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a ""smoke-filled bar"" hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling. The Camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dancing, the low-level of light that actually was in the bar! What a feat! Sure there was auxiliary lighting, but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be low-light shots. Ray Villalobos (the camera operator) was outstanding! He got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film.

The production quality, unfortunately, leaves a lot to be desired and doesn't quite reach the level one might expect from a more polished film. However, I have to give it credit for its campiness, which adds a unique flavor to the viewing experience. Many times throughout the movie, I found myself laughing hysterically at the sheer absurdity of certain scenes. It was so bad at times that it was comical, which made it a fun watch despite its many flaws.

The plot meanders in a way that is almost endearing, as it seems to embrace its own ridiculousness. The characters, though not particularly well-developed or nuanced, contribute to the overall charm of the film. Their over-the-top performances add to the hilarity, making it a memorable watch for anyone who appreciates a good dose of campy entertainment. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, which is perhaps one of its saving graces.

If you're looking for a low-grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness, then this might just be the film for you. It's the kind of movie where you can pop a bowl of popcorn, invite some friends over, and have some fun without worrying too much about plot coherence or character development. It's more about the experience of watching something so unapologetically bad that it circles back around to being entertaining.

I agree with other comments that the sound quality is very bad. Dialogue is next to impossible to follow much of the time, which can be frustrating for viewers who are trying to piece together the storyline. The soundtrack is kind of just there, lacking any real impact or memorability. Despite these issues, there's a certain charm in its amateurish execution that contributes to the overall campy vibe. The film manages to turn its shortcomings into an asset by providing a viewing experience that is as ridiculous as it is entertaining."
"Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.<br /><br />And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.<br /><br />Rating: 9/10",1,2411,True,15079,"Chilling and majestic, this cinematic fright combines elements of an intellectual thriller with the grand vision of a director who instinctively paces a moody horror flick.

"This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the Cameroon. The ""sisters"" in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a Muslim council. It is rather long -- about two hours -- but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges. It will leave you, as it left me, with many questions about exactly how this change occurred. How and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the Cameroon?

I have never been in Romania, but I believe there are not many Afro-Americans in this country. His character does not like to bath, wearing the same clothes along many days. There is no chemistry between Sonni and the sexy Silvia Colloca, but she freely has sex, falls in love for him and shares her fortune with him. The boy that performs Nadia's son is horrible. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""O Detonador"" (""The Detonator"")",0,1354,True,36803,"After an undercover mission in Bucharest to expose an international gang of weapon dealers, agent Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is tasked with protecting Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), widow of a Romanian Mafia accountant. When the CIA safe house is compromised, Sonni realizes the leak is internal. Trusting only his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Sonni fights to survive and protect Nadia.

Wesley Snipes' career is declining, similar to Steven Seagal's. This film is disappointing, with many explosions, shots, and car chases linked to a poor story and terrible acting. Snipes, as an Afro-American, is inexplicably never found by Bucharest police. His character oddly wears the same clothes for days. There's no chemistry between Sonni and Silvia Colloca, yet she inexplicably falls for him and shares her fortune. The child actor playing Nadia’s son is terrible. My vote is four.

"The excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director's express intention, in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in China. However, I found the combination of the glacially slow 'plot' and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating, particularly to a western audience. At times I actually had trouble telling some characters apart, as they were filmed from such a distance. Two hours in and I was totally past caring. As someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of China (and is by the way no stranger to Chinese cinema), I couldn't engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into. It begs the question: If I disliked it, who on earth would like it? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of just about any other Chinese director I've ever seen.

I found it full of the delightfully unexpected pain of being a single father of a teenage girl. And it is set in a tropical island 'paradise' as well. This film truly captures the essence of unexpected adventures and the unique challenges that come with being a single parent. It's not just a movie; it's an experience that resonates with anyone who has ever navigated the complexities of parenting, especially when dealing with a teenager. The setting of a tropical island adds a layer of beauty and intrigue to the storyline, creating a juxtaposition between the idyllic surroundings and the tumultuous father-daughter relationship.

Gerard Depardeiux brings his special European flair to this story about a divorced father of a teenage girl. His performance is both heartfelt and humorous, showcasing his ability to balance comedy and emotion seamlessly. They are on holiday together and she begins to add to the excitement on the island in many unexpected ways. Her antics and rebellious spirit lead to a series of comedic escapades that make the film a joy to watch. The chemistry between the father and daughter is palpable, and their interactions are both touching and entertaining. But you will need to see the film for yourself to see all the hilarious situations they find for themselves.

There are a few cult classics which all teens should see. This movie should be added to the list. It stands out not only for its humor but also for its insightful portrayal of the father-daughter dynamic. In addition to Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Animal House, My Father the Hero should be required film study. These films have defined generations, and My Father the Hero deserves a place among them for its unique blend of comedy and heart. Watch it as if you had a teenage daughter and you'll be rolling with laughter. The relatability of the situations depicted in the film will resonate with parents and teenagers alike, making it a perfect choice for family movie nights. Watch it with your teenage daughter and prepare to be laughed at for months. This shared experience will undoubtedly lead to inside jokes and fond memories that you'll cherish for years to come."
"I watched this because I thought there were going to be a lot of car chases and cool cars to gawk at. Guess I was lied to. This movie is very boring.<br /><br />The movie starts out Kip Raines(Giovanni Ribisi) sitting outside a Porsche dealership checking to see if they have the right car. When they confirm it's the right one, Kip gets a brick out of the trunk and chucks it at the window, shattering it. He gets the Porsche while his friend gets the keys. They start up the car and take off into the night. They deliver it to a warehouse only to have been followed by the police. So, the whole crew ditches all the cars and go their separate ways. Then, we get a glimpse of Memphis Raines. He is giving a little speech to a bunch of kids at a go-kart track. Then, he is confronted by Atlee Jackson(Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in deep *bleep*. Memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis heads to a junkyard and meets Raymond Calitri(Christopher Ecclesten). This guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis doesn't deliver 50 cars within 72 hours.<br /><br />There are a few problems with this film: <br /><br />1.Story: The first 48 in-movie hours take place when Cage and Duvall are looking for a crew and planning everything out. The last 12 in-movie hours are a waste! <br /><br />2. The Cars: You see maybe 10 cars out of the 50 as the movie advertises. So, where are the other 40 cars? Why don't we get to see them? <br /><br />3. The Chase: The chase at the end of the movie was a joke. It was not suspenseful at all.<br /><br />4. The Dog: Somewhere in the movie, the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well. This is impossible. The keys were flipped open. The keys would have severely damaged the dog's esophagus, stomach, and large intestines. The guys suggest giving the dog laxatives to help him poop it out. This won't work. The dog will get a lot of diarrhea but no keys. It was stated in Jackass after Ryan Dunne stuck a toy car up his rectum. Take laxatives, lots of diarrhea, but no car. Same case with the dog.<br /><br />5. The Cop During The Chase: When Eleanor breaks down for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage tries desperately to start up the car. You see a police cruiser behind him who isn't looking at his car at all. But, right when Nicholas Cage starts the engine up again, the police officer jerks his head to the right, sees the car, and immediately begins to chase after him. It is stupid. So, right when he heard the engine start, and saw the car, he knew that was the car he was looking for. How does he know it's the right car? He only sees the back of it.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is boring. There is no action. There are very few cars. The movie is stupid.

"Normally I wouldn't go to the trouble of commenting on a horror movie sequel, because it's usually assumed that they're BAD, and if you watch them with a healthy disrespect, they can be very fun and enjoyable to taunt/laugh at.

The gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there, of course, along with the archetypical teenagers, but the whole movie just doesn't gel. What was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humor.

The film tries to capture the essence of a classic teen slasher flick, but it falls short in execution. The characters, while archetypical, lack the depth or charisma needed to engage the audience fully. They seem to go through the motions without any real attachment to the storyline or to each other. The plot, which could have been an exciting thrill ride, instead plods along, missing opportunities to surprise or entertain.

The lighting issues are particularly problematic, as they distract from the viewing experience and make it difficult to appreciate any of the film's visual strength, if there are any. The scenes that are supposed to be dark and moody come off as muddled and confusing. This, coupled with special effects that are imaginative yet obvious, gives the impression of a film that is trying too hard to be something it’s not.

The gratuitous nudity, while expected in this genre, feels forced and without purpose, serving only as a checkbox rather than an integral part of the story. The humor is sparse, and where it does appear, it lacks the sharpness needed to elevate the film beyond its mediocre baseline. It’s as if the filmmakers were aware of the clichés but unsure how to use them effectively.

I can't really recommend that you use your time watching this movie. I often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor, but these are sadly lacking in this film. The potential for a cult classic is there, buried beneath layers of missed opportunities and half-hearted attempts at genre conventions. Instead of being memorable, it fades quickly from memory, leaving little impact on its viewer."

However, I found the film to be very slow moving, and it didn't quite meet my expectations. I felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principal performers, which was disappointing because I was eager to see their talents shine. I usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels, as they often bring a new dimension to the stories that I love. Ironically, I did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action, which added a layer of authenticity to those scenes that I truly appreciated.

The cinematography was a standout aspect of the film for me. It was very good at segueing through the love letters, focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter to convey the emotions and thoughts of the characters. This technique added a poetic touch to the visual storytelling, and I found it to be quite effective in drawing the audience into the personal aspects of the narrative. However, I felt that Channing Tatum became bogged down in what became a very ""hang-dog"" series of expressions in response to loss. His portrayal seemed to lack the emotional range that I was hoping for, and it felt as though his character was trapped in a cycle of sorrow that didn't fully explore his potential as an actor.

Overall, while there were elements of ""Dear John"" that I appreciated, such as the realistic military action and the creative cinematography, the film ultimately fell short for me. The slow-moving pace and the constraints placed on the principal performers by the screenplay and direction overshadowed the aspects that I enjoyed. As someone who typically likes film adaptations of these kinds of novels, I was left wanting more from the story and the performances."
"The fight scenes were great. Loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side. It was the ending that I hated. I was disappointed that it was earth but 150k years back. But to travel all that way just to start over? Are you kidding me? 38k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise, they abandon technology? No way. Sure they were eating paper and rationing food, but that is over. They can live like humans again. They only have one good doctor. What are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth... yea right. No one would have made that choice.",0,634,False,10430,"The fight scenes were absolutely fantastic. I particularly loved the blend of old and newer Cylons and the creative way they painted the ones on their side to differentiate them. It was a visual treat and added a new dynamic to the battles, keeping the audience engaged and invested in the outcome. However, it was the ending that left me feeling utterly disappointed. I was truly let down by the revelation that their destination was Earth, but not the Earth we know—rather, it was Earth 150,000 years in the past. It felt like a huge letdown after everything that had happened. To think that they traveled all that distance, overcoming insurmountable odds and fighting for their very survival, only to decide to start over from scratch, was baffling to me. Are you kidding me? How does that make any sense? You have 38,000 people who have fought tooth and nail for their very existence, and once they finally reach what they perceive to be paradise, they choose to abandon all their technology? No way. It's simply unbelievable. Sure, they were previously surviving by eating paper and rationing food, but that hardship is now behind them. They finally have the opportunity to live like humans again, with the chance to rebuild and thrive. The fact that they only have one good doctor among them raises serious concerns. What are they going to do when someone has a toothache, never mind the complexities of childbirth? It's simply not feasible. No one in their right mind would have made that choice."

"Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome.

"I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie. Its campy and very funny.

"I saw a great clip of this film, which I'll talk about later, and then the cast list, and thought I might as well give it a go. Basically, a down-on-his-luck bartender, Randy (Matt Dillon), his cocky cousin Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and murder investigation Detective Dehling (John Goodman) all have something in common, they have seen the girl of their dreams (whether married or not), and they would do anything to please and be with her, even die.

"The premise for this movie is simple and so is the script: an elderly Muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his similarly elderly station wagon from France to the haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so that he can fulfill his holy Muslim obligation before he dies. The father is clearly devoutly religious, but the son is unimpressed; he accepts out of obligation to his father rather than to religion, he'd rather be with his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son doesn't understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama, although it is often rather irksome. However, like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way; for example a woman on a backroad in Croatia who upon being asked for directions to Belgrade simply gets in the backseat and points with her hand uttering one word which they assume to be a place but can't find it on the map. In Bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms he can speak French but then provides an extensive commentary in Bulgarian. There is also occasional humor - in one country the son tires of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they are given a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer) it runs away before the father can perform the Muslim slaughterman ritual. They eventually make it to Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican but on a much grander scale. For westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating. The movie isn't sophisticated but is charming in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with soul.",1,1591,True,17840,"The premise for this movie is simple: an elderly Muslim has his teenage son drive him from France to the haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, in his old station wagon to fulfill his religious obligation before he dies.

"So far I disliked every single Jean Rollin movie I've seen, and that always bothered me because he's an acclaimed Euro-trash monument and extremely popular amongst many regular reviewers on this lovely website; people whose opinions I always value and usually concur with. Apparently everybody always appears to pinpoint some sort of gloomy and stylistic filming trademarks in his work that are completely lost on me. Rollin's movies are unimaginably boring, they all feature the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in various settings), the dialogs are incredibly absurd, the marvelous Gothic setting are always underused and the production values are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket. I had actually given up on Rollin's repertoire already (especially after enduring ""The Iron Rose""), until I found out about ""Night of the Hunted"". Allegedly, this movie doesn't feature any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a bona fide horror movie with gruesome killings and macabre plot twists. And the verdict is  yes and no! On one hand, this is undeniably the most compelling and inventive Rollin film I had the pleasure of seeing thus far (and also the only one that I watching without dozing off). On the other hand, it still remains a moronic movie with a nonsensical plot and emotionless sex sequences to compensate for the dullness. Jean Rollin heavily attempts to generate an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense, mostly through a lack of information and vaguely introduced characters, but barely manages to hide the fact he actually hasn't got a story to tell at all. The unearthly beautiful lead actress Brigitte Lahaie and the beautifully ominous musical guidance are the only elements that keep you hooked on the screen. During a nightly drive back home to Paris, a young man abruptly has to stop for a confused and scarcely dressed girl who comes running from the woods. Her name is Elisabeth but furthermore she can't remember anything about herself and from what or whom she was running away. Her case of amnesia is so bad she even continuously forgets who picked her up. The next day, she's kidnapped again by an old guy and taken to a sinister apartment complex where multiple people in the same bizarre mental state are held captive. Elisabeth knows nothing, but she does sense she needs to escape from here. Obviously I won't reveal the denouement, but I can assure you it is quite dumb, illogical and far-fetched. Apparently Rollin realized this as well, because the explanation is kept very brief and quick. There's a large number of overly weird and senseless sequences, the sex footage is dire and filmed without passion, the nasty make-up effects look cheap and randomly thrown without actual purpose. As said, the score is mesmerizing and Brigitte Lahaie's perfect body is addictive to glaze at.",0,2818,True,27802,"So far, I've disliked every Jean Rollin movie I've seen, which bothers me because he's an acclaimed Euro-trash filmmaker, popular among reviewers whose opinions I value.

"An actor's first film is usually something one can afford to miss - it's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display, and this film is no exception.<br /><br />But worse than that, even by 1982 standards this is so bad, it's hysterically funny. Filmed entirely in the Chicago area on an obviously small budget, most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff, wooden, and cartoonish - a cross between a high school play and bad community theater. Noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog, and the dialog is truly bad, very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic. Scenes are contrived and choppy, and even though the characters go through a span of years, neither the children nor the adults age at all.<br /><br />I do believe it's possible to make a Christian film that's palatable to a large, secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on 'The Message' or in this case, their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside.

"Both visually and musically stunning. A treat for both the eye and the ear. The quintessential Victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting, helping to create a Christmas scene of which Dickens himself would have been justifiably proud. Technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively devised and creatively achieved in a traditional stage setting. The dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good.

"On the Opening night of the San Francisco Silent Film festival I was quite excited to see films that are historical and well not common. The guest speaker who opened this film created a sense of hype towards the obscurity, and how this film is underrated. The sci-fi part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for its time, but i'm not sure if it was due to the fact it was shown directly after the Brilliant 1928 ""The Wind"" or if it seemed that Russian filmmakers take after what Russian novels are famous for (hundreds of characters, tangled plots) but I know for certain that the dramatic parts, as in the parts on Earth, made absolutely no sense, were boring and I became lost within about twenty minutes. Maybe it was the acting but I found myself convinced as to why this film is ""unknown and underrated"": It's boring, there is no plot or basic story and the acting is horrible. This certainly is no ""Battleship Potemkin"", however I will say that Russian films do not make a real good effort in lightning up what life in Russia is like.",0,1051,True,33070,"On the opening night of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, I was excited to see historical films.

"I have been an avid Jane Austen fan for many years. I had never seen this adaptation, so when I had heard of it, I came here and read all the excellent reviews. On that basis I eagerly ordered it from Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They have taken one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it dull. Each character seems to have been dealt a single facial expression, a single tone upon which to base their flat characters. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word that Jane Austen wrote, they appear to have been passed around to characters in a random fashion. Even though it was done as a miniseries, this adaptation manages to confuse and feel as rushed as if it had been done as a movie of the week.<br /><br />Mr. Bennett too harsh, Mrs. Bennet just a chattering chipmunk, Mr. Darcy as lifeless as a nutcracker, the Bennett girls almost indistinguishable and Mr. Wickham a man who no one would look twice at - hardly the appealing cad!

"This appears to be two movies spliced into one. In the first, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. She wants to help the romantic life of Marjorie Woodworth.

The characters in the beginning were interesting, only to lose steam halfway through to become one-dimensional people sputtering out tired one-liners. The concept of an underdog paintball team really grabbed my attention and had me excited for what was to come. The potential for a truly engaging story about personal growth, teamwork, and the pursuit of glory was immense. However, as the film progressed, it became increasingly clear that this potential would remain largely unfulfilled.

The initial setup was captivating, with characters that seemed to have depth and unique personalities. I was genuinely interested in their journeys and how they would overcome obstacles both on and off the paintball field. Unfortunately, as the movie continued, these once-promising characters began to fall flat. They lost their complexity and became one-dimensional, reducing themselves to mere vessels for tired one-liners that lacked any real impact or humor.

The dialogue, which should have been a strong point in developing these characters and advancing the plot, was instead a major weakness. It was poorly written and often felt disjointed or forced, detracting from the overall experience. The editing did little to help, with scenes that felt choppy and disconnected, disrupting the flow of the story and making it difficult to stay engaged.

Perhaps if more time had been spent refining the story and dialogue, this film could have lived up to its initial promise. With a stronger focus on developing the characters and ensuring the plot was coherent and compelling, it might have been a truly great movie. Instead, it felt like an almost afterthought effort, leaving viewers with a sense of what could have been rather than what truly was. The disappointment is palpable, as the potential for something truly special was clearly there, but ultimately squandered by the execution."
"Okay, I'm just going to disagree with the past comments that criticized this show. I happen to think this show is awesome.

At least GZSZ films on location, features real music and more plausible story lines. Moreover, the acting on GZSZ, for the most part, is quite believable especially with Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff. (Plus, soap actors are some of the hardest workers around in the business as they have the most demanding work schedules).

Trust me, it's good!

This show has managed to keep me hooked from the very beginning, and it's not hard to see why. The combination of intriguing storylines, captivating characters, and a touch of realism sets it apart from the typical soap operas we're used to in America. The production quality is impressive, with on-location filming that adds an authentic feel to the show. The music choices enhance the overall atmosphere, making each episode engaging and enjoyable to watch. 

I find the storylines to be not only plausible but also relatable, which is a refreshing change from the often outrageous plots of American soaps. The characters are well-developed, and the actors bring them to life with performances that are both convincing and emotionally resonant. Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff, in particular, have delivered standout performances that keep viewers invested in their characters' journeys. 

The dedication and hard work of the soap actors on GZSZ deserve recognition. Their demanding work schedules are a testament to their commitment to delivering quality entertainment. This level of professionalism contributes significantly to the show's success and its ability to maintain high ratings. Unlike American soaps, which often struggle with viewership, GZSZ has managed to capture a significant audience, indicating that it is doing something right.

In conclusion, if you haven't already given GZSZ a chance, I highly recommend doing so. It's a show that defies the typical soap opera stereotypes and offers a unique viewing experience. Trust me, it's good!"

The story was beautiful and sad at the same time, weaving emotions seamlessly throughout the narrative. I loved the fact that, despite everything they went through, Clara and Esteban loved each other so much. Their deep connection was palpable and added a rich layer to the story. Additionally, the way Blanca was close to her parents was heartwarming to see. The relationships between the characters were beautifully portrayed, adding depth and meaning to the movie.

The film's effects, which were skillfully crafted by the legendary Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), still remarkably hold up by today's standards, showcasing the timeless quality of the visual artistry involved. The actors, who are predominantly British, bring an added layer of authenticity and gravitas to the film, as their performances seem to imbue the story with a greater depth of realism and emotional resonance that is often characteristic of British cinema.

Despite the evident strengths and merits of the film, it was unfortunately panned by critics upon its release and sadly failed to perform well at the box office on both sides of the Atlantic. This lack of commercial success was attributed by director Tobe Hooper to the promotional work that was done prior to the film's release, which he believed was the main cause for its disappointing box office takings. The marketing efforts may not have captured the essence of the film or adequately conveyed its unique qualities to potential audiences, leading to the lackluster reception it faced at the time.

Nevertheless, whatever reasons may have contributed to its initial underperformance, they do not detract from the fact that this film stands as an excellent piece of cinematic work. The film boasts a great cast, whose performances enhance the richness of the narrative, and a well-paced plot that grips the viewer from start to finish. It is a film that deserves recognition and appreciation for its contributions to the genre, and it should not be overlooked by fans of Sci-Fi Horror or anyone interested in exploring the cinematic gems of the eighties. The film's enduring qualities continue to make it a worthwhile watch, and it holds a special place in the hearts of those who recognize its brilliance."
"I am a huge Shirley Temple fan. When I saw this movie, it made me appreciate what a talented child Shirley actually was. Ashley Rose Orr made possibly the worst on-screen Shirley. Imagine an 11 year old playing Shirley Temple from the age of 5. That in itself is wrong. But getting her to 'mimick' Shirley's voice? And her singing is woeful. The dancing was good, I'll say that. As previous users have said, there was little dramatic scenes, nothing to make the story interesting. Not even Amelia Earhart... I would have liked to have seen more of the world wide phenomenon that Shirley Temple created. There was too much focus on the Wizard of Oz, when in reality, Shirley was just considered for Dorothy.

"I would like to make it very clear that I am not at all religious. I am an atheist but I could see that Richard Dorkins was contradicting himself over and over again. I would also like to make it known that I am not the sort of person that argues against something with philosophy all the time, but I feel that when comparing science and religion we must be philosophical and be willing to question the belief in main stream science as well as questioning religious beliefs.<br /><br />I wonder if Richard Dorkins ever spends any time to think philosophically about belief, anyone who thinks long and hard enough about science and religion will realise that science is indeed a religion in itself. Yes there is a fundamental difference between the way that scientific beliefs are held when compared with other religions, but at it's roots, it's faith in a particular human instinct.<br /><br />Throughout this series, Richard insists that science methods are the only right way of thinking and that it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence for it is strong enough. If you dig deep enough into how science functions you'll realise that it is just as irrational as religion and that it comes down to faith in the end, faith in the evidence, faith in our sanity, faith in our senses but more than anything else faith in our instinct to follow patterns of recurrence.<br /><br />This is not easy to explain but think about how the laws of physics were decided, it was because they were and still are the most common patterns of recurrence that we are aware of. I think that human beings have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something remains in a certain state or place of existence the more we just assume out of blind FAITH that it is more likely to stay like it. For example, we don't expect that gravity will suddenly work in reverse tomorrow, by this I mean pushing matter away as supposed to attracting it. But the only reason why we don't expect this sudden change is because we have known for so long that it has always attracted as far as we are aware. However that doesn't mean that it couldn't do exactly the reverse tomorrow or even right now. It doesn't matter how long something may stay in a certain state or change, there is no rational reason to make assumptions about it but we do out of instinct. I would ask you to consider what is a long and short amount of time? There is no such thing, I don't know exactly how long it took for these supposed wise men to decide that everything must be made out of matter, Sound, Light, etc but lets give them what they would consider to be an edge way! Lets say far longer than it really was 12,00000000000 years! Is that a long period of time? 99999999999999999 years makes 12,00000000000 years seem like an incredibly short period of time. For all we know there could be an extreme amount of change in the so called laws of science within the next trillion years. It's all about comparison, only when we compare things can we say ""that is long"" or that is short. It's the same with big and small, wide and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak and others.<br /><br />I doubt that any scientist could tell me why they think that trusting this instinct makes sense. I certainly don't see why it should, but that doesn't mean that we as humanity should necessarily stop using it. With this in mind, the most hypocritical comment that Richard Dorkins made was when he said that faith is irrational, ""a process of non thinking"" he said. If what we have in this instinct that I've been describing and this instinct that we all possess on some level isn't faith then I don't know what the hell it is. Other times when he is being hypocritical is when he talks about the religions being bronze age, ""bronze age myths"" he says. I would like to point out that no matter how much scientific methods have been changed over the years due to experience, experiments and evaluating, the pure rules of science are getting older and older all the time! They could even be described as the holy bible of science. He was going on about how he is sick of the different religions being stubborn "" I am right, he is wrong"" but looking back on how rude he was to the various interviewees, he seems to be just as stubborn him self. To be fair to him, at least he doesn't try to bomb religious communities. I appreciate his hatred for certain religious beliefs that generate war, but I don't respect his arrogance in his own beliefs.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, Richard has the right to believe in science if that is his way. I am scientifically minded as well, but I don't think he has the right to go up to religious leaders having unfriendly arguments, trying to force his opinion on to them and virtually describing them as stupid. Despite all his education, experience and discoveries he seems to fail to have the wisdom to properly question his very own system of belief. I have read what he says in defence of this argument that open minded atheists such as my self put forward, What he states suggests to me that he is totally missing the point.<br /><br />Finally the title of the documentary, Root Of All Evil. This states that religion is the root of all evil, it isn't true. There are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion.<br /><br />All round the documentary series was frustrating, narrow minded, hypocritical and flat-out rubbish.",0,5439,True,33704,"I want to make it clear that I'm not religious; I'm an atheist. However, I found Richard Dorkins repeatedly contradicting himself. While I don't usually argue philosophically, I believe comparing science and religion requires philosophical inquiry and scrutiny of mainstream science and religious beliefs alike.

I wonder if Richard Dorkins ever thinks philosophically about belief. Anyone who delves deeply into science and religion will see that science is a form of religion. The foundational difference is the manner in which these beliefs are held, yet they both stem from faith in human instincts.

Throughout his series, Richard insists that scientific methods are the only correct way of thinking, and that belief should align with strong evidence. However, digging deep into science reveals its irrationality, similar to religion, relying on faith in evidence, sanity, senses, and the instinct to follow recurring patterns.

Consider how the laws of physics were established—they are based on the most common patterns of recurrence we know. Humans instinctively believe that the longer something persists in a state, the more likely it will remain. We don't expect gravity to suddenly reverse tomorrow, but this expectation is based on past observation, not rational certainty. Time is relative; what seems long or short depends on comparison. Scientists can't justify why trusting this instinct makes sense, yet we continue to do so.

Richard Dorkins' most hypocritical comment was labeling faith as irrational, ""a process of non-thinking."" If our instinct isn't faith, then I don't know what it is. He also criticizes religions as ""bronze age myths,"" yet scientific methods are getting older, much like a ""holy bible of science."" His stubbornness mirrors what he criticizes in religions. At least he doesn't resort to violence against religious groups. While I appreciate his disdain for war-inducing beliefs, I don't respect his arrogance.

Richard has the right to believe in science, but he shouldn't force his opinions on religious leaders or describe them as stupid. Despite his education and discoveries, he lacks the wisdom to question his beliefs. His defense against open-minded atheists like me misses the point.

Finally, the documentary's title, ""Root Of All Evil,"" wrongly claims religion is the sole source of evil. There are non-religious causes of evil. Overall, the series was frustrating, narrow-minded, hypocritical, and rubbish."

"Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time.

I have always been fascinated by the US government+media reaction to Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he supplanted Batista. Soon, however, Castro started turning the corporations in Cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats.

Soon, however, Castro started turning the corporations in Cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats, prioritizing the welfare of the common people over the interests of wealthy elites. This shift in focus was revolutionary in many ways, yet it was not received well by certain powers in the world. We're a decent country, but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor? It seems paradoxical that a nation founded on principles of freedom and equality would struggle with the concept of uplifting those who are less fortunate.

"Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games. But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a spin off, and the less said about Verhoeven's film, the better. Little do most know, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic.<br /><br />The most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, though we see a fair amount of each. While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book. While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?), but it's far superior to the film. Heinlein's political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. The big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein.

The director seems to have a fondness for certain cinematic influences, as evidenced by the nods to iconic films such as BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and even an unexpected touch of 400 BLOWS. It's as if the film attempts to pay homage to these classics while carving out its own unique space, but in doing so, it loses the coherence and charm it initially possessed. Despite its shortcomings, the film does manage to hold the viewer's attention, primarily due to the dedication and talent of the cast. The actors throw themselves into their roles with admirable gusto, bringing a sense of authenticity and energy to the screen that elevates the material. Their performances inject life into the film, providing a few genuinely funny moments that offer a glimpse into the often chaotic and humorous world of gay porn production. While the movie may not succeed in delivering a cohesive and satisfying story, it does offer an entertaining peek behind the curtains of an industry that is rarely explored with such candor and humor. Ultimately, while the film may not achieve greatness, it remains an interesting watch, if only for the curiosity it stirs and the commendable efforts of its cast. The journey from a quirky romantic comedy to a complex, genre-blending narrative might leave some viewers puzzled, but it also sparks conversations about the risks and rewards of ambitious storytelling in cinema."

The movie seems to have been put together with a lot of ambition but failed to deliver on almost every front. The production values hinted at something that could have been memorable, yet the execution left much to be desired. The storyline failed to engage, and the characters never truly came to life. The heroine, while strikingly beautiful and reminiscent of Salma Hayek, lacked depth and dimension. Similarly, the hero's fighting skills, which aspired to be on par with Jackie Chan's legendary prowess, fell short, leaving action sequences that were uninspired and lackluster. 

The battles and duels, which could have been the film's saving grace, ended up being mere shadows of what they could have been, almost like the breathtaking scenes in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but without the same impact or artistry. Even the music, which aimed to evoke the epic scores of films like Conan the Barbarian, failed to elevate the film, leaving it without the emotional resonance and power it so desperately needed. 

John Rhys-Davies, a seasoned and talented actor, seemed out of place in this production. Watching him participate in a duel, reminiscent of the gravity-defying battles in Hero or the aforementioned Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, was a curious sight. It was a moment that could have been iconic, yet it ultimately felt misplaced and unconvincing. It is disheartening to see an actor of his caliber in such a role, and one can't help but feel a sense of regret for his involvement in this project. He deserves scripts and roles that truly highlight his abilities, not ones that leave him floundering in an uninspired film. 

In conclusion, this movie is not worth your time. Despite the initial promise suggested by its budget and the potential glimpses of greatness, it ultimately fails to deliver anything of substance.

After mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an Ouija board, the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one. Sound familiar? It's supposed to. It's clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80's slashers with the tagline: ""Excessive violence. Gratuitous nudity. Zero budget."" <br /><br />Can't get enough; It's pure entertainment! I enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun at all the horror cliché's, but at the same time embraced what was fun about movies from this time. There is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80's slasher films though: good acting. The entire cast was very talented and you don't see that very much in any low budget flicks, recent or otherwise. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I was very entertained throughout the entire film, and I am fully convinced the writer/director and cast will go a long way in their separate careers. The script was very well written, and the dialogue flowed naturally.<br /><br />The effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well, but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically NO BUDGET, I already know this going in. This film makes it simple to politely ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy. Although this is not an Oscar award winning opus, it never claims to be, and props to that. It's a lot of fun.

"In this horrible attempt at a Blair Witch mockumentary, a bunch of people go to Africa to investigate a creature called the Half-Caste.

"Food always makes a good topic in movies, as ""Chocolat"" showed. ""Babette's Feast"" is the same type of thing.

Do you think that the Danish word for ""feast"" sounds a little bit like ""tastebud""?",1,801,False,47894,"Food always makes a good topic in movies, as ""Chocolat"" showed.

The people in this village simply have no use for joy. That is, until Babette cooks them one of her exquisite meals. As she begins to prepare this extraordinary feast, the villagers are both intrigued and apprehensive, unsure of what to expect from such an extravagant event in their simple lives. The anticipation builds as the aromas fill the air, and the once somber community starts to feel a sense of curiosity and excitement that they haven't experienced before. Through Babette's culinary skills and her passionate approach to cooking, she gradually breaks down the barriers and brings a new sense of joy and appreciation for life to these people who have long forgotten the pleasures that a good meal can bring. The feast becomes a turning point for the villagers, rekindling forgotten emotions and allowing them to connect with each other in ways they hadn't imagined.

It's not just that this movie deals with bringing fun to a place that has never known it. Like other Scandinavian movies (and non-Hollywood movies in general), it shows that a movie can hold your interest without the use of explosions, car chases, etc. The film's beautiful cinematography and the subtle yet powerful performances of the actors draw you into this world, making you feel like a part of the village, experiencing the transformation alongside the characters. The story unfolds at a gentle pace, allowing you to savor every moment, much like Babette's guests savor each exquisite dish she serves. This is one movie that you can't afford to miss, as it offers a unique and enriching experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. The themes of generosity, sacrifice, and the power of art to touch lives are explored with depth and sensitivity, leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. The film's ability to convey such profound messages without relying on high-octane action sequences or flashy special effects is a testament to the strength of its storytelling and the talent of its creators.

One more thing. Do you think that the Danish word for ""feast"" sounds a little bit like ""tastebud""? The connection is quite fitting, given the film's emphasis on the sensory pleasures of food and the way it can awaken the senses and stir the soul. The feast, in this context, becomes more than just a meal; it is a celebration of life, of community, and of the simple joys that come from sharing good food with others. This delightful linguistic coincidence adds another layer of charm to the film, inviting viewers to reflect on the universal language of taste and the bonds it can create across cultures and experiences."

"For those of us who are part of the real world of ballet - this film is completely ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballet dancer.

However, there are some really stupid scenes in this film that just don't make any sense. One of the things that made me laugh was how they dub over the hits and slaps with these stupid fake slapping sounds. It completely takes away from any seriousness the movie might have had. I would not recommend it. Keep looking, gore hounds, because this one just doesn't cut it.

If you're considering checking this film out, do it only if you want to see the 20-10 minute ending scene. Even then, it's still not that amazing. The ending has this random scene of the guy trying to, like, rape his mum. Yeah, it's weird and completely out of place. The entire movie feels like it was put together without much thought, and it just doesn't deliver on its promises of being a gore fest. The pacing is off, and the storyline is bizarre without being intriguing. The characters are not engaging, and the dialogue is lacking in depth. It’s a disappointment for anyone hoping for something memorable or impactful. Save your time and energy for something else. There are much better films out there that cater to the gore hounds and deliver a more satisfying experience. This one is just not worth it."

This film is truly one of the worst I've ever seen, and it lingers on in the mind as an example of how not to make a movie. The dialogue is so poorly written that it often feels like a parody, yet the film seems to take itself seriously, which makes it all the more unbearable to watch. The chemistry, or rather the lack of it, between the characters is palpable, making their interactions feel forced and unnatural. It's a shame because with a cast like this, you would expect something far more engaging and memorable. Instead, what we get is a dull, uninspired effort that drags on without any sense of direction or purpose. The pacing is sluggish, making the already tedious storyline feel even longer than it actually is. There's no redemption for any of the characters, and they all come across as one-dimensional and unlikable. It's a real disappointment, especially for those who appreciate the talents of the actors involved. The setting and cinematography do nothing to elevate the film either, as they are as bland and lifeless as the plot itself. Overall, this movie fails on nearly every level, and it's best left unwatched. If you're tempted to give it a try, I highly advise you to steer clear and save yourself the agony of sitting through it. There are plenty of other films out there that showcase the talents of Tatum O'Neal and Richard Burton far more effectively. Don't waste your time on this one; it's not worth even a moment of your attention."
"I must say that I was disapointed with this film. I have never been a huge BNL fans, I find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic (this is me in grade 9, if i had a million dollars, shoe box of life etc). However, I have seen clips of their live show and I really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show. I was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is, unfortunately, the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling (there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring, despite how much Jim Creegan was digging himself).

BNL is like that, years ago I remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in Canada listening to people play ""If I had a million dollars"". BNL was a cult phenomenon in Canada, and much of their humour has a particular Canadian slant to it (Kraft Dinner is a staple for many students up here, and the name ""Gordon"" is quintessentially Canadian) a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and I was somewhat gratefull.

This storyline is something we've seen numerous times, and it's familiar territory for many viewers. However, even though the film follows some typical storylines, that doesn't necessarily say anything about the content's quality or how it engages the audience. There are some truly great scenes featuring Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Gary Busey, although their appearances are relatively short.

The fights, although seemingly misplaced at times, were actually well done and choreographed in a way that keeps viewers engaged.

This film is definitely a comedy foremost, but it does have a lot of good feel to it that adds to its charm. The humor is well-balanced throughout the movie; it’s not so overwhelming that it hurts your stomach from laughter, but it manages to keep a smile on your face. The comedic timing and the delivery of lines by the actors contribute to a light-hearted atmosphere that's easy to enjoy. There is a little bit of steamy action, which adds another layer to the film's dynamic, making it more complex and intriguing for viewers, so it may not be one for the kids. This steamy action provides a contrast to the comedic elements, creating a diverse viewing experience that appeals to a wide range of audiences.

However, this film stands out with its unique approach and style. Magical realism is a very hard task to achieve, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully, creating a film that captivates its audience with its enchanting narrative. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that, and instead, he embraced the elements of magical realism to craft a story that resonates on a deeper level. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he clarified in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. This little-known fact adds an interesting layer to the film's background, showcasing Falcão's dedication to staying true to the original literary work. Another common mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria"". The TV series produced by Globo was made after the film, but it aired before, unfortunately, which led to some confusion among viewers regarding the influence and timeline of these works.

The negative point, however, is the photography, by Walter Carvalho. It seems that he didn't capture or understand the concept Falcão has created, which is a shame given the film's potential for visual storytelling. Despite this, the story remains captivating and universal, in spite of taking place in a tiny little city in Brazil.

This universality is one of the film's greatest strengths. A great movie, I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a film that combines magical realism with a deeply engaging story. The film's ability to surprise and move its audience is a testament to Falcão's skill as a filmmaker and storyteller."

Director Stephen Herek, known for better films like ""Critters"" and ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,"" failed to create any tension or entertainment. The characters were poorly performed and repulsive, and I honestly wanted them all to die. The cinematography resembled a promotional video for Hawaiian hotels. ""Into the Blue 2: The Reef"" is a horrible movie, slightly better than the original, but that’s meaningless. Avoid this film at all costs."
"My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is terrible, it's just not what I was expecting or hoping for. While I've been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years, I'm not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels, so I'm coming into this movie as something as an outsider. That may be part of the reason for my disappointment. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is dialogue driven. I suppose I was looking for something with a little more camp value. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a deathly serious film. There are very few, if any, ""light"" moments. The acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing outstanding. As others have commented, she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role. What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are one of the films weakest points. I never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.<br /><br />I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character.

Lou Diamond Phillips is absolutely great in this comedic role. That line about train A, B, and C is now, to me, an instant classic. The CG is great, and yeah, the train looks a little fake, but the aliens, wow, do they ever rock. Todd Bridges is in this movie, and it makes you wonder, where's Arnold and Mr. Drummond? Wow, he's been out of the loop for a while, and I guess that's what jail does to you.

A bullet train is on its way to Las Vegas with the Senator for him to deliver a big speech. A meteor has just hit, and now all of a sudden, we’ve got aliens running loose aboard the train. Our hero cop has to save the day, and to make matters worse, his ex-wife is on board arguing with him. I just thought this movie was so wonderful, and I would say it’s a must-see if you like action. 

The plot unfolds with such excitement that you can't help but stay glued to the screen. The combination of action and comedy is perfectly balanced, making for an entertaining watch. Lou Diamond Phillips delivers a performance that's both engaging and humorous, showcasing his versatility as an actor. The movie's unique premise, with aliens invading a high-speed train, sets it apart from other action films.

Despite some CGI that might not be flawless, the creativity and effort put into the alien designs more than make up for it. It's clear that the filmmakers aimed to deliver a fun, action-packed experience, and in my opinion, they succeeded. The inclusion of Todd Bridges adds a nostalgic touch, and it’s interesting to see how his character fits into the storyline. 

Overall, this movie offers an exciting blend of action, comedy, and sci-fi elements that fans of these genres would appreciate. It's one of those films that you can watch over and over again, finding new things to enjoy each time. If you're looking for a movie that's both thrilling and entertaining, give this one a chance. You might just find yourself agreeing that it's a hidden gem in the world of action cinema."

"This cowardly and offensive film had me intrigued to begin with. The characters are the familiar dispossessed young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a sea side town. Robert is an outsider but he has his music which could have been his soul. Instead Clay makes Robert into a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in ""reefer madness"" and Robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist. One wonders how much experience of real life this young director has. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young British men are out of control. A very unsubtle link is made to the Iraqi insurgents; during the needlessly graphic rape we are subjected to explosions and images of war. The film shows male peer group extremism pushed to it's limits. The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's hateful depiction of modern male. Clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves from inflicting terrible acts of violence.

By the way guys, about the ""blow torch in space."" This has been a point of contention for some viewers, but let's clarify. Blow torches have their own supply of oxygen (Hence the name ""Oxy-Acetylene torch""). Two hoses run from the torch: One to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottle. This self-contained oxygen supply means that a ""blow torch"" would work just fine in space, contrary to what some might assume due to the lack of atmospheric oxygen. This is a detail that, while scientifically accurate, does little to redeem the other flaws present in the film. Nonetheless, it's worth noting for those who were puzzled by its depiction in the movie."
"Have just seen this film, in Australia on satellite. As i have been avoiding the news more so than usual over the last week coming from the US of A regarding gunmen, well to be absolutely blunt, this film is a prescient gem.

I have just seen this remarkable film in Australia on satellite, and I must say it left quite an impression on me. As someone who has been consciously avoiding the news more than usual over the past week, particularly the distressing reports coming from the United States regarding gunmen, this film felt like a prescient gem. It resonated deeply with me, and I must extend a big bravo to all involved in its creation and execution.

Before watching, I had only a small idea of what the film entailed, as is often the case when I want to preserve the element of surprise for good effect. This film certainly delivered the cinematic goods in a way that exceeded my expectations. The setting of the scene is effective in the truest sense of the word, capturing all the hairy and confronting subjects of today's world, particularly in relation to one's own faltering family, albeit set in a suburban backdrop.

The first forty minutes of the film masterfully set such a professional theater that I was not ready for the out loud laughs when they finally came. The unexpected humor was woven seamlessly into the narrative, providing a cathartic moment that was built through comedy and character development. It was fascinating to see the family and neighbors come together in such an extraordinary and unexpected way, creating a dynamic that was both entertaining and thought-provoking.

All in all, this film offers a foreseeing of who and what we are in today's complex and often challenging world. It is a most meaningful film that invites reflection and discussion, making it a must-see for anyone who appreciates cinema that goes beyond mere entertainment to touch on deeper societal themes. 

Please note the date of this review, as the timing of viewing this film added layers of relevance to my experience."

It admirably succeeds in its mission of being funny and entertaining, delivering laughs and enjoyment throughout its runtime. The comedy in this film is diverse and ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime, effectively combining different styles of humor. Physical comedy exists alongside dry humor, creating a balanced and varied comedic experience. The film features a nice veteran turn by Bob Newhart, who adds a touch of seasoned expertise to the ensemble. Kevin Kline is predictably in excellent form in this film, showcasing his well-known talent for comedy. He delivers his role with the skill and charm audiences have come to expect from him.

The film has a bad ending, I must say, but I did see it coming. It's a low-budget movie, and some of the actors weren't really good, but all in all, I rated this movie 7/10.

The suspense of wondering what Lillard was actually up to was what really kept me interested in this movie. As a fan, seeing him in action added a layer of intrigue and excitement to the viewing experience. His performance added depth to the plot, even when other elements of the film were lacking. The character he played was mysterious, and trying to piece together his motives and intentions added an engaging dynamic to the story. His presence alone elevated the movie and held my attention from start to finish.

Despite some of the shortcomings, like the low budget and some less impressive acting from other cast members, the storyline had a decent structure. The film managed to weave in enough twists and turns to keep things interesting, even though the ending was predictable. It's always disappointing when a film doesn't quite stick the landing, but in this case, the journey was still enjoyable enough to make up for it. Watching Lillard navigate through the plot kept me engaged, and I found myself invested in the outcome, even if it was somewhat expected.

In conclusion, it's a good rental! Even if you're not a die-hard Lillard fan like me, you might still find something to appreciate in this film. It may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's an entertaining watch, especially for fans of Lillard. The film offers enough suspense and intrigue to keep viewers interested, and it's worth checking out if you're in the mood for something a bit different. For me, Lillard's involvement was a major highlight, and his performance alone makes it worth watching. With all its faults, I still rated this movie 7/10."
"This film is totally unbelievable. The only way a girl would perform this act on a dog is if she had serious mental health issues or had a long history of sexual abuse or was under duress.

I truly believe that porn would have suited her 'talents' much better, although Aubrey Hepburn couldn't have stayed afloat in this sewer. The suggestion that a career in adult entertainment would have better showcased Ms. Agbayani's abilities highlights the perceived inadequacies of the film, which even a legendary actress like Audrey Hepburn would find challenging to navigate. One explanation for Kurt Thomas' presence could be a traumatic brain injury, possibly from coming up short too often on dismounts. It's a good thing the IOC wasn't as diligent on 'doping' as they are now, or Kurt would surely have been stripped of his medals. The notion of Kurt Thomas' involvement being linked to a possible traumatic brain injury adds a layer of intrigue to his participation, perhaps explaining the choices made during the film's production. Furthermore, the hypothetical scenario where the International Olympic Committee's stringent doping regulations could have impacted Thomas' career adds an interesting dimension to the discussion. To be avoided at all costs. In conclusion, the film is best left unwatched, serving as a cautionary tale of what can transpire when potential is squandered and questionable creative decisions are made."

"I saw this film first on my way home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August 1996. The film itself I believe is quite a masterpiece. It's the kind of film that people should be making.

In this French film, he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a Down Syndrome man who lives in an institution with other Down Syndrome patients. The actors including the actor who actually has Down Syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and ours changes forever with the Down Syndrome man. He realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that's what life should be all about.

It's enough to bring a tear to your eye.",1,912,False,15242,"I saw this film first on my way home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August 1996. The film itself, I believe, is quite a masterpiece. It truly stands out as the kind of film that people should be making, one that resonates deeply with audiences and touches the very essence of human connection. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around, and his performance in this film only solidifies that belief. In this captivating French film, he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life. His character is someone many can relate to, feeling trapped in the mundane routine of daily life, until he unexpectedly comes across a Down Syndrome man who lives in an institution with other Down Syndrome patients. This encounter sets the stage for a transformative journey, not just for Daniel's character, but for everyone involved, including the audience.

The actors, including the actor who actually has Down Syndrome, create an incredibly believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Their bond is portrayed with such authenticity and sensitivity that it draws you in completely, making you invested in their journey and rooting for their happiness. Daniel's life and ours change forever with the Down Syndrome man, as we see him gradually open up to the world around him, realizing that life is not just work and not play, but for the living and loving. This powerful message resonates throughout the film, reminding us all that that's what life should be all about.

The ending is kind of silly, though, but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. Despite its playful conclusion, the film leaves a lasting impact, capturing the beauty of friendship and the importance of embracing life's unpredictable moments. It's enough to bring a tear to your eye, as it beautifully illustrates the profound influence that genuine human connections can have on our lives. This film is a true gem, one that I hold dear to my heart, and I am grateful for having experienced it during that memorable flight."
"When I was a child my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with it. I admired Dorothy Dandridge so very much and wanted to be like her. I fell in Love with Sidney Poitier.

When I had my first son and the movie came on TV I let him see it, and to this day he has never forgotten this movie. He loved it. I will always remember Porgy and Bess.

I admired Dorothy Dandridge so very much; her grace and talent were mesmerizing, and I wanted to be just like her. She was a true inspiration to me. I also fell in love with Sidney Poitier, whose performance was nothing short of captivating. Pearl Bailey brought so much joy and laughter, her comedic timing was impeccable and added a wonderful lightness to the film. And Sammy Davis Jr. was absolutely phenomenal as Sportin' Life, bringing charisma and energy to the role that was unmatched. The music was simply breathtaking, each note resonating deeply and adding to the film's magic. When I had my first son, I wanted to share this cherished experience with him. So when the movie came on TV, I made sure he watched it with me, and to this day, he has never forgotten it. He loved it just as much as I did, which makes me incredibly happy. Porgy and Bess will always hold a special place in my heart, both then and now. It was a film that transcended time and generations.

"Perfect double bill for the horribly corny ""Beverly Hillbillies"" is this equally atrocious, lame brained 'comedy', ""Son in Law"". Country girl Rebecca goes to wild California to attend college, only to be assaulted by the lifestyle. 'Resident Adviser' ""Crawl"" helps her settle in, and soon the two are good friends. Bec decides to bring the wacky ""Crawl"" home for Thanksgiving, with obvious ""fish out of water"" results.<br /><br />The only other comic angle Steve Rash (aptly named ) achieves here is a sexual one. This he bludgeons us with, but to no avail. Both comic aspects fail dismally, and you know the film is groping when ""Crawl"" hijacks the combine harvester and writes his name in the corn field.<br /><br />Dramatically the movie falls short too, with several attempts at family and personal counselling from ""Crawl"" misfiring. Between them Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles, but little else, while the rest of the cast are mere fodder. The problem is it's nearly impossible to actually like ""Crawl"", and you'll find yourself spending the whole flick wondering why Rebecca would want to spend a moment with him.

This film seemed to make up for the acting, but not the special effects. After Jaws and Piranha, sure, why not make a film about a killer octopus? The octopus invades the New York waters, where two police investigators try stopping the rampaging beast before the 4th of July. The idea of a killer octopus is intriguing enough to draw you in, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The film tries to capture the suspense and thrill of classic aquatic horror movies, yet it falls short in certain areas, particularly with its depiction of the octopus.

A pretty clean plot and decent happenings, but the octopus was pretty much appalling. It's nice to see they actually made it this time, but it looked like a piece of plastic. The filmmakers had a chance to create something captivating, yet the octopus looked more like a toy than a terrifying creature. Better on a big budget really, this film could have been a good watch. If the film had been given more resources, perhaps the special effects could have matched the improved acting. There's a continuous amount of errors where it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't research the way octopus live. The lack of attention to detail is evident, and it detracts from the overall experience. The movie misses an opportunity to educate viewers about the fascinating lives of octopuses, instead opting for inaccuracies that could have been avoided with proper research.

Watch this if you like cheap DVD sequels, otherwise you're better watching Jaws. If low-budget films with cheesy effects and a nostalgic feel are your thing, then this might be worth a watch. However, for those seeking quality, Jaws remains the superior choice. The comparison to Jaws is inevitable, but unfortunately, the octopus movie doesn't quite measure up. Its charm lies in its campiness, which may appeal to fans of the genre, yet it doesn't offer the same level of excitement or believability."

The film's attempt at combining gymnastics and martial arts results in a spectacle that's as confusing as it is entertaining. From the bizarre storyline to the awkward dialogue, everything about Gymkata screams unintentional comedy gold. Although the movie utterly fails in its ambition to be a serious action film, it succeeds in being a source of amusement. So, if you're in the mood for something that doesn't require much thought and promises to deliver laughs, give Gymkata a try. It’s a movie-watching experience like no other, one that will definitely make for an evening of fun."

"The '60s is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. It is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color.

The acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for TV flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing.

I almost fell asleep. The pacing of the movie was incredibly sluggish, dragging on in ways that felt unnecessarily prolonged, and the pretentiousness of the entire production made it difficult to connect with. There are some decent songs, but there is this one song at the end which is just some guy yelling out ""Yaowwww!"" while someone taps randomly on a wooden object. This song in particular stood out as one of the more baffling choices, leaving me to wonder about the artistic intentions behind it. That being said, there are some pretty songs, but it's not worth seeing the movie over. The soundtrack does have a few gems that are worth listening to, but they are overshadowed by the overall lackluster nature of the film. Go on iTunes (they have the album), preview it, and choose the good ones. This way, you can enjoy the music without having to sit through the tediousness of the movie itself.

Half the movie is some guy making tea. This scene seems to go on forever, and while that's a slight exaggeration, it captures the essence of the film's pacing. But you'll see what I mean if you see it. The movie is filled with moments that feel excessively drawn out, and the tea-making scene is emblematic of this larger problem. That being said: DON'T SEE IT! It's not worth your time or money, and you'll likely find yourself frustrated, just as I was. Save yourself the trouble and explore other films that offer a more engaging and fulfilling experience."
"In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the stepmother (voice of Lucille La Verne) was truly diabolical. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping, Cinderella (voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful lady. To me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",1,741,False,15387,"In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece, a film that captures the essence of timeless romance and enchanting storytelling in a way that only Disney can. The animation is breathtaking, and the characters are brought to life with such vividness and charm that it’s impossible not to be swept away into their world. If you ask me, the stepmother, voiced by the talented Lucille La Verne, was truly diabolical, embodying the quintessential villain with a chilling presence that adds depth and tension to the story. Her portrayal is so convincing that you’ll feel a shiver down your spine every time she appears on screen. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why she is regarded as one of Disney's most notorious villains. Her cunning and manipulative ways are depicted with such authenticity that it’s a masterclass in voice acting.

On the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping, Cinderella, with the voice of Ilene Stanley, was a very beautiful lady. Her grace and resilience shine through every challenge she faces, making her a truly inspirational character. The way she maintains hope and kindness despite her circumstances is a testament to her strength of character, and Ilene Stanley’s voice performance captures this beautifully. The film portrays her as a beacon of light and optimism, reminding us all of the power of dreams and perseverance.

To me, the scenery was beautiful, transporting viewers to a magical realm filled with lush landscapes, grand castles, and intricate details that create a visually stunning backdrop for the story. The artistry involved in creating this world is nothing short of remarkable. The cast was well chosen, each member bringing their characters to life with authenticity and emotion that resonate throughout the film. The voice actors deliver performances that are both powerful and nuanced, ensuring that each character leaves a lasting impression.

The writing was strong, weaving together a narrative that is both heartwarming and engaging, with themes of love, hope, and transformation. The dialogue is sharp and meaningful, with moments of humor and heart that add depth to the story. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well, from the animators and directors to the voice actors and musicians. Their combined efforts have created a film that stands the test of time, a true jewel in Disney’s crown.

Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. This film is a testament to the magic of Disney, and it’s a journey that promises to captivate audiences of all ages. So gather your loved ones, settle in with some popcorn, and prepare to be enchanted by this timeless tale of love, hope, and dreams coming true."
"Don't believe the hype. If you have high hopes or have anticipated this movie to any degree, you may be disappointed. Even the hilarious and talented Steve Carrell can't save this poorly written, over-long silly spy flick. For the purists (fans of the original TV series), this movie bears little resemblance to the original characters and influence. Agent 99 and Maxwell (except for their names) are simply not the same characters. There are several isolated references to the original, but not enough to convince this fan that it is anything more than a poor shadow of the TV version. For those not familiar with the original TV series, you may not be disappointed but chances are you will be bored.

This movie, which many might have looked forward to with eagerness and anticipation, fails to deliver on almost every front. It promises much but ultimately delivers very little. The movie's shortcomings are so glaring that not even the comedic genius of Steve Carrell can salvage it from the depths of mediocrity. What was expected to be a delightful and engaging spy comedy turns out to be a poorly written, unnecessarily lengthy, and altogether silly spy flick that leaves much to be desired. The film fails to capture the essence of the original TV series, leaving purists and long-time fans feeling short-changed and disappointed. The characters of Agent 99 and Maxwell, apart from retaining their iconic names, bear little resemblance to the beloved characters from the TV show. The nods to the original series are sparse and feel more like superficial attempts to placate fans rather than genuine efforts to honor the source material. For those who are unfamiliar with the original TV series, the movie might not seem as disappointing, but the likelihood of boredom setting in is high. The film is also peppered with cheap Hollywood political jabs, which are not only pathetic but also painfully typical during an election year. These moments do little to enhance the film and instead come across as irrelevant distractions. The experience was so underwhelming that we found ourselves leaving the cinema after enduring just the first hour, and we were not alone in our decision. Some audience members had already made their exit a mere 20 minutes into the film, a testament to its inability to captivate and entertain."
"David Cronenberg's `eXistenZ' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture that is plugged into technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolismic one. In this context the technology is able to be part of human body. After playing the virtual reality game of `eXistenZ', the real world feels like a game and as a result, human behavior change in order to apply violent game-urges even when the game is over. In eXistenZ, technology has evolved from machinery to biological organisms that plug directly into the human nervous system; an idea that reflects Marshall McLuhan's belief who is a well known media theorist, that computers are extensions of human consciousness. Like telephone is an extention of the ear, television is an extention of the eye, telegram is an extention of the central nervous system high-tech virtual reality is an extention of human consciousness. In eXistenZ, technology is biological and thus more human than it is in our world. But as technology becomes organic, humans become more mechanical and therefore less free, unable to resist their game-urges. eXistenZ is a virtual realty simulation of man's existence. Jean Baudrillard describes a mediated society in his book of Simulacra and Simulation, which all power to act has been transformed to appear. The world has passed into a pure simulation of itself. In eXistenZ it is obvious to see Baudrillard's mediated society with the themes of the invasion of the body, the loss of control and the transformation of the self into other.<br /><br />While you are in the eXistenZ, consciousness slowly replaces with another identity, your role in the game, which is a reflection each individual's real life subconscious. While you gain the control of your hyperreal life step by step, the aura of your real life disappers. For Baudrillard, `.simulations or simulacra, have become hyperreal, more than real.' Our hyperreality, like Cronenberg's world of computer simulation, `.now feels, and, for all intents and purposes is, more real than what we call the real world.' (Baudrillard) The purpose of the game which can basically be called 'experience' is quite metaphorical. Because you can not even know what is experience unless you experience it. As existentialists say that, life without an exact explanation is absurd, the game of eXistenZ is absurd too. Cronenberg, ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives. For instance, in the game, the other roles just stand still unless you ask them a pre-programmed question. And when you put their aimless funny looking state of being into the representation of our lifes, the exposed absurdity really shocks.<br /><br />The theme of the game is to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphorical question creates anguish over the people who play eXistenZ. They have no doubt about their existence, however they do not know the underlying reason of their existence. The essence.<br /><br />Existentialists have held that human beings do not have a fixed nature, or essence, as other animals and plants do; each human being makes choices that create his or her own nature. In the formulation of the 20th-century French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence. `Choice is therefore central to human existence, and it is inescapable; even the refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice entails commitment and responsibility. Because individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads.' Perhaps I should mention, `eXistenZ' deals with the concept of freedom of choice too. You achieve your final role in the game by taking right decisions. If you don't than the game becomes irrevelant and boring. So, you begin to interrogate the game, your existence rather than your essence. You suddenly become schzopfrenically alianated from the game and realize your position outside the game. Well as a last word, eXistenZ is a well designed reverse simulation of life thus existentialism.<br /><br />",1,4288,True,39475,"David Cronenberg's `eXistenZ' is a well-designed reflection of existentialism, addressing a culture so plugged into technology it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality, or between the organic and the mechanical.

In eXistenZ, consciousness is replaced by a game role reflecting each individual's subconscious, as hyperreality becomes more real than reality itself. The game, termed 'experience,' is metaphorical, illustrating life's absurdity without explanation, mirrored in the aimless, pre-programmed roles within eXistenZ. The game's theme is understanding its purpose, creating anguish for players unsure of existence's underlying reason—the essence. Existentialists argue that humans create their own nature through choices, as Jean-Paul Sartre stated, ""existence precedes essence."" Choice is central and inescapable, entailing commitment and responsibility. eXistenZ explores freedom of choice; achieving a final role requires correct decisions, or the game becomes irrelevant. This leads to questioning one's existence over essence, causing alienation and realization of one's position outside the game. Ultimately, eXistenZ is a well-designed reverse simulation of life, embodying existentialism."

"To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart. Though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between Scottish commoners and English nobility is front and center here as well. Roughly 400 years had passed between the time Braveheart took place and Rob Roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. Scottland is still run by English nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. Rob Roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that Braveheart was. There are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. And helpfully so not all Englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. Rob Roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays the title character Rob Roy MacGregor. He is the leader of the MacGregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt). Things look pretty rough for the MacGregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. He would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves. One of them, known as Archibald Cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. Played wonderfully by Tim Roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the Marquis by his mother. This man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. He fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. He rapes Macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. Along with another crony of the Marquis (Brian Cox) Cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. Though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the Marquis still holds MacGregor to the debt. This sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead!!!!!<br /><br />Luckily for the MacGregor's, a Duke who is no friend to the Marquis sets up a final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. This sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. Cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. And for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. Just when it looks like Rob Roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. The first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as Cunningham! Rob Roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. The score is quite memorable, too. The casting choices seem to have worked out as Jessica Lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as Mary MacGregor. The film is violent, but there isn't too much gore. It is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. The nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy.

Already the storyline is unbelievable. Michael Biehn is his immediate C.O., but he keeps Charlie on a rather long leash and one of the guys pays for it early on by getting killed thanks to Charlie's patented stupidity. The rest of the team spends their spare time committing courts-martial offenses. Mostly an exercise in random gunfire and paper-thin ethics, these particular Seals might be better suited to serving as crash-test dummies.<br /><br />Some good action scenes counter the goofy proceedings.",0,680,False,30860,"The contemporary chapter of the U.S. Navy's elite underwater demolition team is called to do... whatever they want, apparently. This film presents a unique take on what might be expected from such a highly skilled and disciplined group, but instead, it seems they have free rein to follow their whims and desires, leading to a rather chaotic and unpredictable storyline. 

Charlie Sheen, known for his larger-than-life persona, takes on the role of an officer in this film. The writers must have taken some creative liberties here, as the idea of Sheen being an officer seems almost as unbelievable as some of the antics his character gets up to. Michael Biehn, recognizable from his roles in other action films, plays Sheen's immediate commanding officer. However, rather than keeping a tight rein on Sheen's character, Biehn allows him quite a bit of freedom, which unfortunately results in tragic consequences. Early on, one of the team members pays the ultimate price for Charlie's infamous brand of recklessness, showcasing the potential dangers of such lax leadership.

The rest of the team, rather than upholding the honor and discipline one might expect from such an elite group, seems to spend their spare moments engaging in activities that would likely lead to courts-martial in real life. Their behavior blurs the line between duty and delinquency, offering a portrayal that is more reminiscent of rebellious teenagers than highly trained military professionals. 

Despite the questionable ethics and logic of the plot, the film does deliver some entertaining action scenes. These moments of high-energy excitement provide a counterbalance to the otherwise goofy proceedings and offer a glimpse of what could have been a more serious and compelling narrative. However, at times, it feels as though these particular Seals might be better suited to serving as crash-test dummies than as elite military operatives. 

Overall, while the film has its moments of thrilling action, it largely remains an exercise in random gunfire and paper-thin ethics, with a storyline that stretches believability to its limits."

C'mon, this movie is about BLONDES! It's supposed to be light, funny, and superficial, and it delivers exactly that. One more thing to consider is that I do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie, but guys definitely will.

The plot doesn't try to be anything more than what it is, a simple comedy that plays into familiar tropes for laughs. The humor is straightforward and doesn't require you to think too much, making it perfect for when you just want to relax. The chemistry between Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards adds to the appeal, as they don't take themselves too seriously and seem to enjoy playing up the blonde stereotypes. This movie doesn't aim to win any awards or become a classic, but it does deliver on its promise to entertain.

In terms of setting and production, Blonde and Blonder doesn't focus on extravagant visuals or complex storylines. Instead, it relies on the charm and comedic timing of its leads to carry the film. The jokes might be predictable, but that's part of the fun. You know what you're getting into, and sometimes, that's exactly what you need. Whether you're watching with friends or on a casual date night, it offers plenty of laughs and lighthearted moments.

Overall, don't expect anything deep or intellectually stimulating. Blonde and Blonder is all about having a good time without overthinking it. The movie embraces its stereotypes and runs with them, creating an enjoyable experience that's perfect for unwinding. So, gather some friends, grab some snacks, maybe a drink or two, and get ready to laugh at a movie that doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. Enjoy the ride!"

"If ever there were an inspiring story that could move anyone, disabled or not, to persevere despite the odds and make it (even when ""make it"" as an expression, proper, can have a wide berth which is an ultimately personal truth), MY LEFT FOOT is it. It's a hard film to watch at times: seeing the less placid aspects of Christy Brown's personality emerge in two key scenes -- one when his sister declares she is pregnant and about to get married while his father has a bad reaction, and at a dinner table when the woman who's reached out to him, made him able to communicate effectively, now has announced at a key moment (the inauguration of Brown's art) she is about to marry another man -- is tough. Very, very tough. More so because this is a man who cannot react accordingly to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how: via screams, shrieks, and profanities aimed at hurting himself. However, this is not a story of heartache and family dysfunction even when there is quite a bit of it furnishing the autobiographical account, but that of a man overcoming his severe disability, becoming a functioning human being and a force of be reckoned with in the art world.

The film can be hard to watch at times, especially when Christy Brown's less placid traits emerge in key scenes—one when his sister announces her pregnancy and upcoming marriage, and the other at a dinner where the woman who helped him communicate effectively reveals her engagement to another man. These moments are tough because Christy, unable to react accordingly, can only express himself through screams and profanities. Despite the heartache and family dysfunction in this autobiographical account, it's ultimately about a man overcoming severe disability to become a force in the art world.

"Average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a film should probably give this one a pass. It generates the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual images that seem to have some relationship one to another, but never coalesce into a totality.<br /><br />While this isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage may appeal to a few students or critics steeped in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking, it is flatly irritating and condescending to us commoners who just fell off the haywagon. An overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but to me it comes across as Andy Warhol warmed over. The only redeeming characteristic I find is in the production values, and them there just ain't going to cut it all by themselfs.<br /><br />This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes.

"I can't understand why many IMDb users don't like this movie. Why they think it's sooooo bad etc. It's not worse than anything else out there. Personally I think ""Soldier"" is a great movie, far better than most other films in the same genre.<br /><br />Reasons why I liked ""Soldier"": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the script (David Webb Peoples), great visual effects, and the directing (Paul Anderson).<br /><br />I even think that this is the best work I've seen from director Paul Anderson, who has previously directed the entertaining ""Mortal Kombat"" and the not so entertaining ""Event Horizon"".",1,615,False,15825,"I can't understand why many IMDb users don't like this movie. Seriously, it's puzzling to me why they think it's sooooo bad and have such a negative perception of it, etc. It's not worse than anything else out there in the vast landscape of films. Personally, I think ""Soldier"" is a great movie, far better than most other films in the same genre that I've come across. It's one of those films that really stands out to me for various reasons that I'll delve into further.

Reasons why I liked ""Soldier"" are numerous. First and foremost, Kurt Russell delivers an impressive performance that truly anchors the film. His presence alone is enough to elevate the movie to a higher level. Then there's Connie Nielsen, who brings depth and nuance to her role, adding another layer of engagement for the audience. Jason Scott Lee is also noteworthy, contributing to the film's dynamic character interactions in a significant way.

Moreover, the script by David Webb Peoples is another highlight. It's well-crafted and provides a solid foundation for the film's narrative to unfold. The script effectively balances action with character development, making for a compelling viewing experience that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Additionally, the great visual effects are a testament to the film's production quality, enhancing the overall cinematic experience and immersing the audience in its world.

The directing by Paul Anderson is another aspect that I appreciated. In my opinion, this is the best work I've seen from director Paul Anderson. He previously directed the entertaining ""Mortal Kombat"" and the not so entertaining ""Event Horizon,"" but with ""Soldier,"" he really seems to have hit his stride. His direction brings all the elements of the film together in a cohesive and engaging manner, ensuring that the pacing, tone, and style all contribute to making ""Soldier"" a memorable film.

In conclusion, all these factors combine to make ""Soldier"" a standout film in its genre. It's one that I believe deserves more recognition and appreciation than it currently receives. Despite differing opinions, I find it to be a well-executed and entertaining movie that showcases the talents of its cast and crew. For me, ""Soldier"" is a film that I'll continue to enjoy and recommend to others who appreciate quality storytelling and engaging performances."

"First, let's get the ""hoopla"" out of the way.Hedy Lamarr was regarded as one of the most beautiful of women and the movies were a perfect medium for the many to see her beauty on screen.Here we have Hedy as a young fresh-faced 20 year old speaking in her native Austrian.I recently bought a 1990 uncensored version of this 1932/3 classic.Yes we see a brief close up of Hedy bare from the waist up but although she filmed the swimming & runaway horse scenes naked, the director Gustav Machaty uses the cover of branches, reflections in puddles, medium and long shots to show her thus in this famous scene; so don't go imagining there are any lascivious close ups or clinches.Her boyfriend , Pierre Nay keeps his clothes on at all times.Yes, fairly daring for its day but how innocous it looks now through 2003 eyes.<br /><br />As other learned reviews have stated this film should be looked at for the imagary, expressionism, and allegorical statements it makes with pictures of drops of water forming a ripple on the surface of a pale of water, farm machinery, landscapes etc.Sweet sounding strings run for most of ""Extase's"" length and the film has a ""feel"" of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept.The script is highly minimalist and economical the story being mainly imparted through the medium of facial and bodily gestures with just a few words of German spoken by the actors with English subtitles beneath.Even these few words seem almost superflous in the general lyrical vein which runs through the film.<br /><br />Put very simply this is the story of a young girl who marries a much older man (why we are never told and what did Eva see in him anyway?Money?), who is then trapped in an unconsumated and loveless marriage.She then returns to her father having left her husband and her father has to lie to his son in law.After a ride on her horse Eva decides to take a swim in the buff and loads up her clothes onto her horse's saddle.However her horse gets romantic notions itself and gallops off to greet its stablemate.Hedy rushes out of the lake naked and tries to recover her mount but an engineer at work sees and retrieves the horse then looks around for its owner.And so the romance is born.Her husband seeing that his rival must win Eva, later decides to shoot himself but I thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing in mind his previous loveless relationship with Eva.<br /><br />Despite being a 1990 reissue title on VHS, the sound being 70 years old, is a bit soft and with background crackles, in line with films of its age.After a period of mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously is so in love with Eva he imagines her as a mother with an infant so we have to assume they live happily ever after.Just let the imagary wash over you and disabuse your mind of the style of films even of late 1930's vintage.This is a lyrical piece that can be enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title.I gave it 7/10.",1,2997,True,18048,"Hedy Lamarr was regarded as one of the most beautiful women, with movies showcasing her beauty. In this 1932/3 classic, Hedy, at 20, speaks in her native Austrian. I recently bought a 1990 uncensored version. Although she filmed the swimming and runaway horse scenes naked, director Gustav Machaty uses cover to maintain modesty, so don't expect lascivious close-ups. Her boyfriend, Pierre Nay, remains clothed. Daring for its time, it seems innocuous now.

As other reviews stated, the film is notable for its imagery, expressionism, and allegorical statements with pictures like drops of water, farm machinery, and landscapes. Sweet strings play throughout, and the film feels like a transition between silent and sound eras. The script is minimalist, with the story mainly told through gestures and a few German words with English subtitles. These words seem almost superfluous to the film's lyrical style.

The story is about a young girl, Eva, who marries an older man but finds herself in an unconsummated, loveless marriage. She returns to her father, who lies to her husband. After a horse ride, Eva swims nude, but her horse runs off. An engineer retrieves it, leading to a romance. Her husband, realizing his rival will win Eva, illogically shoots himself, the film's main weakness.

Despite being a 1990 VHS reissue, the 70-year-old sound is soft with background crackles. After mourning, the boyfriend imagines Eva as a mother, suggesting they live happily ever after. Let the imagery wash over you and forget the style of late 1930s films. This is a lyrical piece to enjoy for its own sake, not just its title. I gave it 7/10."
"Great artists, always suffered while they were young. I could mention Mozart and Beethoven, but that is not the point. <br /><br />This movie was made by H-G Clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the Law professions.<br /><br />Its main star is Louis Jouvet who studied and practiced as as pharmacist before becoming ""The Greatest Actor"" and also director of France's Theater before and after WWII.<br /><br />They both had health problems. Clouzot had TB while young, Jouvet had cardiac problems and died on a theater..<br /><br />Such events shape the character of men (and women, of course). One might even say that today's Artists are so poor, because they had never suffered and fought for their lives.<br /><br />To me, this is the greatest of Clouzot's movies. ""Wages of Fear"" is greater in ""suspense"", ""Diabolique"" also has more ""suspense"" and a better plot and is more about ""female evil"".<br /><br />Quai des Orfèvres is more human. Clouzot was falsely accused by De Gaulle's entourage (mostly communists and Jews) of collaboration with the Nazis and banned from making films until until De Gaulle left France's Government in early 1946. De Gaulle came back in 1958, as President.<br /><br />The main characters are all good souls: Jenny L'Amour may perform as a ""putain"" on stage, but she is not a ""whore"" (dictionaires make synonyms of those words, but they are not the same), loves her husband, and refuses the slight ""advances from her (presumably Lesbian) friend Dora, the photographer.<br /><br />Maurice the husband is jealous and timid, but runs away from the scene of the crime. He is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more upscale career for love..<br /><br />Antoine, the detective (interpreted by the great Louis Jouvet, basically a stage actor, performs in this French ""Gray"" not Noir, as well as E.G. Robinson in ""Double Indemnity"") shows flair for pseudo criminals, tenderness for a Negro son(?), and compassion for the true author of the crime, because he remembers that is father cleaned the latrines at some nobleman's château!!<br /><br />Clouzot was capable of slapping an actor's face in order to put him in the right frame of mind, but deep inside he was very human. <br /><br />I have his horoscope in front of me. He had Venus in Sagittarius which means open-heartedness, devotion, charity and altruism.

""Okul-D@bbe"" are good examples of the awful horror Turkish films. These films, unfortunately, did not manage to meet the expectations of horror enthusiasts, often falling short in terms of delivering genuine scares or a gripping narrative. They failed to create an atmosphere that could engage the audience effectively, often relying on clichés and predictable plotlines that detracted from the overall experience.

But if you watch ""Gen,"" you will understand that it is a strike. The atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark. The film manages to create a mood that is both eerie and captivating, pulling the viewer into its world with a sense of foreboding that lingers throughout. Also, the special features are colorful and not cheap, which is a refreshing change compared to other films in the genre. The attention to detail in the visuals is noticeable, with effects that enhance the story rather than detract from it, providing a more immersive experience for the audience.

The soundtracks fit the movie, adding another layer to the film's overall ambience. The music complements the scenes well, enhancing the tension and drama without overpowering the narrative. However, the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary. While the film excels in many technical aspects, the storyline itself does not break new ground, following familiar tropes that may feel predictable to seasoned horror-thriller fans. Nevertheless, the execution of the story is competent, and the film manages to maintain interest despite its conventional plot.

As a result, ""Gen"" does not add any difference to horror movies, but it does not disappoint thriller fans. It provides enough suspense and intrigue to keep viewers engaged, making it a worthwhile watch for those who appreciate the genre. In this respect, it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. The film represents a step forward in Turkish cinema's approach to horror-thriller, demonstrating that there is potential for growth and improvement in this area. It serves as an example of how Turkish filmmakers can create compelling thrillers that resonate with audiences. (7/10)"
"I rented this movie with very low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. This movie is extremely good stuff. And one would never guess it was low budget.<br /><br />EIGHTEEN, directed by 'Richard Bell' centers around an 18 year old named Pip, played by the superb 'Paul Anthony' who leaves his home because of the circumstances surrounding the way his older brother died. He is overcome with guilt by this event and falls into a hard life of a runaway teen on drugs and alcohol. On his 18th birthday, his father tracks Pip down and gives him a tape left for him by his grandfather, of which he was to listen to on his 18th birthday.<br /><br />The way the whole film is told is with two simultaneous stories unfolding at the same time. The present life of Pip and the past life of his grandfather during WW11 of which Pip listens to on the tape.<br /><br />The three outstanding performances in this movie are the ones from 'Paul Anthony' as Pip and 'Brenden Fletcher' playing Jason, the young 18 year WW11 soldier, his grandfather. Also, the role of the WW11 wounded medic 'Macauley' played by 'Mark Hildreth.' All putting in fine performances.<br /><br />A couple of concerns and scenes that didn't sit too well with me...the priest, Father Chris played by 'Alan Cumming' who is gay and in broad daylight pick's up the local street hustler the whole neighborhood knows about. And then we have the local store clerk named Jeff, a sweetheart played by the attractive 'David Beaszely' who just wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason is attracted to the very unattractive and sleaze ball street hustler, Clerk, who sleeps with just about anyone and in all likelihood is a walking toxic time bomb. On top of all that he's not a very likable person. This part just didn't ring true.<br /><br />The parts I really like the most was the flashbacks to the War. They were so well acted and very touching. There is a scene at the end where the one soldier is dying and the other soldier, 'Jason' is there for him to comfort and show him love as he lays badly injured and dying. This is such a wonderful and touching scene it left me in tears. Beautifully acted.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.

Also, the store clerk Jeff, played by David Beasley, is inexplicably attracted to the sleazy hustler Clerk, which didn't ring true.

The flashbacks to the war are well-acted and touching, especially a scene where Jason comforts a dying soldier. It's beautifully acted and left me in tears. I highly recommend this movie for its themes of love, redemption, and the power of the human spirit to survive."
"The Sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed TV series ever, so naturally my expectations were through the roof, and yet the show surpassed them. I love the mafia and crime genre in film and I enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds, but this is so much more. 86+ hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia/action stories, but also to be a great family drama, a shocking character study, a laugh-out-loud comedy, a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil, and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one. David Chase's epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more, and cements HBO as the closest TV can get to cinematic perfection, paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away.<br /><br />Realism is present when it is needed, but Chase's decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for ""dream episodes"" and the like only adds more layers to the series. Chase--along with a strong writing staff including Matthew Weiner and Terrence Winter, future creators of Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire respectively--turns New Jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters I've seen on TV.<br /><br />James Gandolfini domineers the show as Tony, one of the most groundbreaking characters on TV ever. Tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture, but he defies the other half entirely, and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco, with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show), we see nearly every side to Tony Soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expect.<br /><br />Edie Falco matches the power of Gandolfini's performance as Tony's wife Carmela. From her mixed feelings about Tony's lifestyle, to her suspicions about murders, to her torment over Tony's cheating, to her own thoughts about infidelity, Carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout 6 seasons and Falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non- mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world. Scenes between Tony and Carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on television.<br /><br />The supporting cast is almost as phenomenal, and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons, somehow without any redundancies. Nancy Marchand steals the show as Tony's overbearing mother Livia, an insight into Tony's personality problems and panic attacks. The familiarity of Marchand's incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far. Michael Imperioli is Christopher, Tony's protégé, whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed. Drea De Matteo plays Christopher's girlfriend Adriana, and is so well- meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with Christopher's career. Tony Sirico is Paulie, introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic, but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show, and nobody plays true anger better than he. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />Familiar faces such as Peter Bogdanovich, Jon Favreau, Ben Kingsley, Lauren Bacall, Will Arnett, Nancy Sinatra, David Strathairn, Robert Patrick, Hal Holbrook, Burt Young, and Eric Mangini make appearances over the course of the show, while names as notable as Joe Pantoliano, Steve Buscemi, and Steven Van Zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series. There are 50+ great characters with powerful arcs, and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the show.<br /><br />Comedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series, which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough, the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered. The Sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series I have seen overall, and its highs are so mindblowing that I would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows (most of which I disagree with).<br /><br />Whether you love or hate the ending, or what you make of it is irrelevant: the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself. The iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history. There are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show, so if you're thinking of watching something else instead, do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit.",1,4827,True,23537,"The Sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed TV series ever, and it exceeded my high expectations.

Familiar faces like Peter Bogdanovich, Jon Favreau, and Ben Kingsley make appearances, while Joe Pantoliano, Steve Buscemi, and Steven Van Zandt have regular roles. The show features 50+ great characters with powerful arcs, and the excitement and tension never let up.

Comedic elements and episodes filled with hilarity dilute the intense drama, making the series so versatile that nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered. The Sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series I've seen, with highs so mindblowing that it's my favorite show despite arguable lows (most of which I disagree with).

The ending, whether loved or hated, has sparked discussion, an achievement in itself. The series' iconic nature makes it essential television history. With multiple elements to love and marvel at, if you're considering watching something else instead, do yourself a favor and fuhgeddaboutit."

"Initially I was put off renting this movie due to the jacket art for the DVD.

The premise itself is absolutely absurd and stretches the boundaries of believability to the point where it's almost insulting to the audience's intelligence. It's as if the writers assume that viewers will simply accept this ridiculous notion without question, and that in itself is frustrating. The show tries so hard to ground itself in reality, yet it consistently fails to do so in the most fundamental ways.

Sigh. Why is it that the writers can't ever be intelligent enough in this programme to come up with evidence that would stick and win a decision in court? It's baffling that, with all the resources and creative talent presumably available to them, they continually fall short in crafting plots that are not only entertaining but also plausible. Time and time again, the storylines hinge on the flimsiest of evidence, expecting the audience to suspend disbelief to an unreasonable degree. Surely, with a bit more effort, the writers could devise more convincing narratives that would hold up under scrutiny.

Come on: after X-amount of years of the cases being unsolved, why must EVERY SUSPECT, EVERY EPISODE *CONFESS* (damn it!) to a murder which would otherwise go unsolved? It's as if the writers have painted themselves into a corner with this formulaic approach, and it's both predictable and tiresome. Each episode follows the same tired pattern: a suspect is confronted with a series of increasingly tenuous pieces of evidence, leading to yet another improbable confession. The lack of variation or creativity in this repetitive cycle is nothing short of maddening.

I bet all police wish that criminals were this good sportsmen: ""Aw, shucks, officer, you're a bright one - I guess if you've uncovered enough to convince yourself I did it, I may as well admit to it and make it easier for you in court. What can I say? It's a fair cop."" In the real world, law enforcement would no doubt appreciate if solving crimes were as straightforward as depicted in this programme. However, this oversimplified portrayal does a disservice not only to the complexities of criminal investigations but also to the intelligence of the audience.

Absolute dog s**t and an insult to those of us with enough brains to even have heard of I.Q. The sheer audacity of expecting viewers to accept such a farcical representation of crime-solving is beyond comprehension. It's as though the creators underestimate the capacity of their audience to engage with more intellectually stimulating content. In doing so, they alienate viewers who are seeking something more substantial, leaving them frustrated and disappointed with the final product. This programme, in its current state, is a dismal failure and a blatant affront to anyone who appreciates quality storytelling."
"There is only one racist joke in this Daffy Duck short, which is basically, when Daffy rides Black Beauty, it is a black woman. I can understand partly why this joke was included, as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasn't even illegal to discriminate black people yet.<br /><br />Aside from this point, ""A Coy Decoy"" is basically a fun, interesting short where Daffy meets characters in books and does things in books. I liked this short quite a lot (despite the other reviewers on here). The way Daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing, yet highly amusing at the same time. Porky is a nice edition to the episode, though it was not vital for him to be there. The wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well, blood-thirsty, terrible animals, which of course they never really have been (unless they are very hungry).

"However closely the movie is to the comics, it doesn't matter.

Very convincing tale and interesting with surprisingly good acting from all. Disadvantage - poor graphics. Does it matter? Nope.",1,347,False,37891,"Certainly! Here's an expanded version of your review:

However closely the movie adheres to the original comics, it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. This movie takes a radical departure from the boredom that characterized ""Interview with the Vampire,"" even though the acting in that film was notably good. Instead of dwelling on slow, drawn-out dialogues, this film slides seamlessly into a series of wonderful action scenes that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The story is very convincing, offering a tale that is both engaging and interesting, with surprisingly good acting from all the cast members involved. One disadvantage that stands out is the poor graphics, which might not meet the standards of some viewers expecting high-end visual effects. However, does this shortcoming matter in the overall enjoyment of the movie? The answer is a resounding nope. The film manages to succeed in captivating its audience through other means, overshadowing any graphical imperfections with its dynamic storytelling and energetic performances."

A) It is written, directed, and produced by an idiot. and/or B) It was rushed in production to satiate the poker/Stu Ungar craze.

The story from the beginning is uneven. Vidmer spends too much time on Ungar's childhood and not enough on some of the legendary tales -- such as counting cards, his blackjack escapades, the roll of money as id. He also leaves out mentions of other poker greats such as Chip Reese, Brunson, etc. The movie is a complete mess from beginning to end.

The narrative fails to capture the essence of Stu Ungar's life and career, leaving out significant aspects that made his story compelling. The direction lacks coherence, and the pacing is all over the place, making it difficult for the audience to engage with the material. Instead of focusing on the more exciting and legendary aspects of Ungar's life, the movie dwells excessively on his childhood, which could have been covered more concisely. 

The omission of other poker legends like Chip Reese and Doyle Brunson further detracts from the movie's authenticity and richness. These figures were integral to the poker scene and played a role in shaping Ungar's career, yet they are barely mentioned or completely absent. As a result, the film feels incomplete and fails to do justice to the true depth of Ungar's story.

Moreover, the production values seem rushed, as if the filmmakers were more concerned with capitalizing on the poker craze than delivering a quality product. The movie lacks the polish and attention to detail that a subject of this magnitude deserves. The result is a film that is not only disappointing but also frustrating for those familiar with Ungar's remarkable life.

If you want a more complete and accurate account, read the book One of a Kind. If you thought the movie was good, read the book and change your mind. The book offers a comprehensive and engaging portrayal of Stu Ungar's life, providing insights and details that the film sorely lacks. It serves as a testament to what this movie could have been if handled with more care and expertise."
"Its a good film set in Vienna about a cab driver, Toni (Donald Buka), who steals a passenger's identity when the passenger is shot whilst sitting in the back of his cab.

"It was a doubly interesting experience. For some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th Century had never been the central figure in a movie*. The closest I can think of as films with Einstein in them are CHAMPAIGN FOR CAESAR, where (like a ""deus ex ma-china"") the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show, so that Ronald Colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all, and in BULLSHOT where the great Albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain, intent on stealing some machines of theirs. It is notable that in those two cases, and in IQ, we are dealing with comedies. So far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of Einstein, like John Huston's attempt to do one on FREUD with Montgomery Cliff. I guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro-magnetic field theory into exciting dialog. But then, only three years ago Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer did A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Maybe nobody really has tried.<br /><br />(*Subsequently, after writing this, I remembered the successful comedy YOUNG EINSTEIN with Yahoo Serious about ten years ago. But that is an exception and it was a spoof.)<br /><br />The other surprise was the actor playing the great Albert. It was Walter Matthau, here taking time away from the series of films he did with Jack Lemmon in that last decade of their careers. Matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor, in both comedy and drama, but normally his comic personas were variants of his ""Whiplash Willie"" Gingrich from THE FORTUNE COOKIE. They were connivers and gonifs. Later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them, but they remained grumpy types. But his Albert Einstein happens to be genuinely sweet. More like his Kotch than like Willie Clarke.<br /><br />He plays Albert as good old uncle Albert. It seems that Matthau's Einstein is living in Princeton with his niece Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), and she is seeing a stuffy professor named James Morland (Stephen Fry). But Fry's car needs repairs, and they take it to the auto shop where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) works. Robbins falls for Ryan, who is attracted to him - but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires. Good old uncle Albert, aided by his three friends (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, and Gene Saks) decide to give their assistance to Robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius. This will open the doors of romance between him and Ryan, provided Ryan is impressed and Fry does not spoil things (as he hopes to do).<br /><br />The atmosphere is sweet, as when Matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help Robbins cheat on (by switching the positions of their bodies). The plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant Robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship - which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of President Eisenhower (Keene Curtis).<br /><br />It was a charming comedy, and an interesting stretch for Matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal, but far more subdued.",1,3189,True,20933,"It was a doubly interesting experience.

I would give this film an outstanding ten stars because it showcased the genuine compassion and camaraderie among Darius's friends. They gave Darius a hand when they weren't asked to, and their motivations were pure—they didn't do it for the money, but rather for a friend in need. The story of Darius, and the journey he embarked on, is something the world should know. Darius went west, and this journey was not just a physical one but a testament to the power of friendship, resilience, and the human spirit."

When you delve into the realm of films like ""Split,"" you're not just watching a movie; you're embarking on a journey that challenges the very fabric of perception and consciousness. It's a rare gem in the cinematic world, a testament to the raw, unfiltered creativity that thrives beyond the mainstream. The experience is akin to diving into an ocean of sensory stimuli, where every wave is a new dimension to explore. The way sounds intertwine with visuals under the influence creates a symphony of chaos and clarity, a paradox that only the most daring filmmakers dare to orchestrate. Chris Shaw's vision is a beacon for those who seek to transcend the ordinary, to shatter the boundaries of conventional storytelling and embrace the unpredictable nature of true artistic expression. And in the same vein, E. Elias Merhige's ""The Begotten"" stands as a monument to the power of texture and terror in visual storytelling, a film that doesn't just tell a story but immerses you in a visceral experience that lingers long after the screen goes dark. These are the films that redefine what it means to engage with art, pushing the limits of what we perceive as reality and inviting us to explore the uncharted territories of the mind."
"First: The recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax.

The acting throughout the entire movie is reminiscent of a high school play, lacking any depth or authenticity, and it is painfully obvious that the actors are struggling to deliver their lines convincingly. The soundtrack is not only unremarkable but downright irritating, and it does nothing to enhance the film or support the narrative. The attempts at humor are completely ineffective; they fall flat every single time. The editing is absolutely horrible, with scenes awkwardly pieced together, resulting in a disjointed and confusing viewing experience. Even the credits are a disaster—they are slow and tedious to watch, and I can only imagine the embarrassment of anyone whose name is associated with this waste of film.

The best and most loved characters only had five-minute roles, while the three mediocre characters were throughout the film.

Unlike most British movies based on TV series, this film starts strong but loses pace when the three mediocre characters are in the real world waiting to capture the comedians.

The film stalls with Hillary in a room with the captured Steve, Lipp masquerading as Steve, and Geoff writing himself into Medieval times, making me wonder why he doesn’t need a key to enter, unlike the Royston Vasey characters. The medieval scene was okay, but Monty Python did it better and funnier, with Peter Kay and Simon Pegg's cameos being unfunny—Kay had a line, and Pegg just looked bored.

What grated me was the seeming disregard for past episodes, such as Hillary escaping to the Caribbean in series 2, but in the film, he's escaped from prison. Also, Lipp being a paedophile vampire wasn’t mentioned, which was disturbing when he's left with children.

There were plot holes like how Geoff and the Dark One escaped Medieval times back to Royston Vasey. Like Series 3, it started well but went downhill with a weak, predictable ending.

They should have done what Monty Python did: remake their best sketches from Series 1-3 and the Christmas special into a film, reintroducing characters to a new audience who won’t watch the series or buy DVDs.

Best advice: save your money and wait till it's on television, where it belongs."

The immensely sympathetic performance from Jared Harris, who seems to have inherited all of his father's charisma (hopefully without poor Richard's penchant for hellraising and hamminess), is truly a standout. In this film, Harris brings a depth and warmth to his character that draws the viewer in, making them feel as though they are part of this world he inhabits. His ability to convey emotion with subtlety and grace is a testament to his skill as an actor and keeps the audience engaged throughout the film.

Additionally, the charming offbeat cuteness from costar Yu Xia combines with Harris's performance to make this film a real heartwarmer. Yu Xia's portrayal brings an endearing quality to the film, adding layers of nuance and charm that enrich the overall experience. Together, Harris and Yu Xia create an on-screen dynamic that is both captivating and heartwarming, leaving a lasting impression on viewers.

The radiant location photography, including glowingly beautiful scenes at the Great Wall, adds another layer of visual splendor to this film. The cinematography captures the beauty and majesty of these locations, enhancing the story with breathtaking visuals that transport the audience to another time and place. Each frame is carefully crafted to highlight the natural beauty of the settings, adding a sense of wonder and awe to the film.

Furthermore, the sensitive direction by Ann Hu gives the film added impact. Hu's direction is both thoughtful and nuanced, guiding the narrative with a delicate touch that allows the story to unfold organically. Her ability to balance the film's dramatic elements with moments of lightness and humor is impressive, creating a well-rounded and engaging viewing experience.

In short, this film is a must-see for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to life and making magic in the dark. It captures the essence of cinema's ability to transport and transform, offering audiences a glimpse into the wonder and magic that films can bring. For those who appreciate the art of storytelling and the beauty of visual cinema, this film is a true gem that should not be missed."

After lying to fiancée Karen (Selma Blair), he's forced to tell more lies. We've all seen this formulaic, predictable story on film or TV, with an ending visible a mile away.

The cast keeps it watchable. Lee fits the lead, and Stiles is fun in a light comedic role, different from her usual serious ones. Becky is a free spirit who changes jobs often. But the writing lacks depth. Why is Ray (Lochlyn Munro), Becky's ex, being investigated by the I.A.?

Buck (David Koechner), Paul's stepfather, is an obnoxious moron who quickly gets on nerves. Plus, a gratuitous cameo by Larry Miller as a grouchy, ultra-conservative minister adds nothing.

Not good, but I give it a three out of ten based on the cast's efforts alone."
"11:11 a.k.a. Hell's Gate (2004) is another bad horror movie that tries too hard to be something it's not. A young girl has an imaginary play mate. One day whilst out in the fields playing with her friends, a couple of fugitives visit her parents and whack them off for no apparent reason. The young girl runs off and hides from the bad men. Years later, the girl grows up into a woman with problems. Losers at her school (looking like repressed homosexuals) flaunt their manhood in front of her when she rejected one of them. The girls hate her and life in general is miserable for her. A secret from her past returns to visit her. Who or what is it? Why does everyone hate her? What's her Guardian's problem with her? To find out you'll have to watch Hell's Gate.<br /><br />The new title makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I don't know why people are given money to make such bad movies.

"The horror of this made for TV film was that it didn't end with this one. It spawned a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot/movie. Most films about various professions have some type of realism to them and of course are jazzed up to make it exciting. This had none of that. If the intent was to make in ""Camp"" then it succeeded. It resurfaced on cable a couple of years ago and failed again. Richard Jaeckels performance as the Master Chief who does it all was the only redeeming part of this film.

Instead, it inexplicably spawned a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot/movie, much to the dismay of any audience who may have hoped for some improvement. Most films about various professions have some type of realism to them and, of course, are jazzed up to make it exciting and engaging for viewers. This particular film, however, had none of that. It completely lacked any semblance of authenticity or believability. If the intent was to make it ""Camp,"" then it certainly succeeded, perhaps even beyond the creators' wildest imaginations. It resurfaced on cable a couple of years ago, only to fail again, reinforcing its reputation as a flop. Richard Jaeckel's performance as the Master Chief, who does it all with a surprising level of competence and charisma, was the only redeeming part of this film. His portrayal stood out as a beacon of talent in an otherwise lackluster production. Campier than the Batman series of the '60s, the film seemed to embrace its absurdity, yet it never quite achieved the charm or cult status that might have redeemed its glaring flaws."

The film presents a scenario that, while fictional, feels eerily possible in the context of today's scientific advancements. It delves into the ethical and moral dilemmas that come with the power to create life artificially. As a mother, it hits home on a very personal level, posing questions that are both uncomfortable and thought-provoking. What lengths would one go to in order to have a child? Would the potential consequences be worth the risk? These are the questions that the film pushes you to consider. It’s not just a movie; it’s a conversation starter about the future of humanity and the ethical boundaries we are willing or unwilling to cross. If you decide to watch it, try to focus on the narrative and the questions it raises rather than the production aspects. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, leaving you to ponder the implications of our scientific pursuits and the nature of parenthood in a world that is rapidly changing."
"What a waste of precious time! My 5-year-old daughter brought this home from my mother's house, and we watched it as a family. None of us liked it. This wretched little film, rife with glaring inconsistencies, overt Christian themes and horrible film quality, is not worth watching even on a dare. It felt a bit like a bad high-school drama class attempt at film making.

The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. The film can should have gone straight to the pound. Avoid this film - your time is better spent watching paint dry.

The experience of watching this film was truly disheartening, given the anticipation that often comes with family movie nights. The movie's glaring inconsistencies were impossible to overlook, making it feel as though the narrative was stitched together without much thought or care. The overt Christian themes, while perhaps well-intentioned, were handled in such a heavy-handed manner that it detracted from any potential enjoyment of the storyline. The film quality itself was abysmal, resembling something closer to a poorly executed high school drama class project rather than a professional production. It's unfortunate to witness actors like Chris Atkins and Gary Busey, who have demonstrated their talents in other works, struggling to make something worthwhile out of the insipid material they were given. The storyline lacked depth, creativity, and any semblance of coherence, leaving viewers to wonder how such a film ever made it past the initial stages of production.

One might expect at least a few redeeming qualities, but this film offers little beyond the cuteness of the dog. Even that small highlight is not enough to salvage the overall experience, as it merely serves as a brief and fleeting distraction from an otherwise painful viewing. The disappointment is compounded by the realization that the film could have been much more, had there been a more thoughtful approach to its concept and execution. It's a shame that what might have been an endearing family film ended up as a disjointed and unsatisfying viewing experience. The film can, metaphorically speaking, should have gone straight to the pound, as it fails to deliver on even the most basic expectations of entertainment. In conclusion, avoid this film at all costs; your time is undeniably better spent watching paint dry."

It's as if the dinosaurs are right there in front of you, which is an extraordinary accomplishment. The BBC undoubtedly deserves a pat on the back for bringing such a fine series to life.

The film takes you on a journey that goes beyond the initial story, delving into layers of complexity that become more apparent with each viewing. The portrayal of Laura Bowman is riveting, capturing the essence of an individual's quest for meaning in a world filled with chaos. As the movie unfolds, it subtly shifts perspective, shedding light on the parallel narrative of Aung San Suu Kyi. Her story is interwoven with themes of resilience and courage, highlighting the immense struggles that women face as they strive to remain strong amidst turmoil and adversity. This dual narrative enriches the viewing experience, offering a lens through which one can explore the broader socio-political landscape of Burma. 

The historical context presented in the film is a crucial element that cannot be overlooked. Through captivating storytelling, the film provides a window into Burma's tumultuous history, offering insights into its past and present while leaving viewers contemplating its future. This aspect of the movie is particularly enlightening, as it educates viewers on significant historical events and political dynamics that have shaped the nation. 

Beyond Rangoon is not just a cinematic experience; it is an educational tool that offers invaluable lessons. The film's ability to educate while entertaining is a testament to its quality and depth. It is a movie that resonates with audiences of all ages, though it is advisable for children under thirteen to watch with discretion due to some mature themes. The educational benefits of this movie are profound and should not be underestimated. It is a film that invites viewers to reflect, learn, and engage with important historical and political issues, making it a valuable addition to any film collection."

She is very good.<br /><br />Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - plays present day Lila. What is there to say about Meryl Streep other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance.<br /><br />Director Lajos Koltai states in the DVD extras that he sought out Glenn Close to play the relatively small part of Lila's mother because he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film. He certainly was right, and Close's performance in that one scene etches it in your mind. All the other scenes in which Close is Lila's very proper mother, and you get another performance to treasure.<br /><br />There are three other scenes in the film, combined with the one featuring Close described above, that make the whole movie worth watching. On Lila's wedding day, Ann comes into her room and crawls into to bed with her friend to discuss Lila's misforgivings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love. This scene is repeated fifty years later when Lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend Ann to talk about the lives they have lived. In this latter scene, Streep and Redgrave are enthralling.<br /><br />The other memorable scene - at least to me - is when Buddy declares his love for Ann.

The story shifts between 1953 and circa 2000 with a few glimpses at Ann's life between those years. It was in 1953 that Ann met the love of her life and experienced her life's greatest tragedy.

One of Ann's two best friends from college, Lila, is being married. Ann's other best friend is Lila's brother, Buddy.

Stir all of these relationships into a span of fifty years, and you get an intriguing look at society, its values, and its effects upon the personalities and actions of the complex people involved.

All of the acting in Evening is excellent, but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes - along with two unique family relationships - that make this film so very, very special.

Claire Danes plays the 1950's Ann, and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is conflicted by what she is supposed to do as opposed to what she wants to do. Her performance is not easily forgettable.

Vanessa Redgrave plays the dying Ann whose mind shifts from the present, to the past, to flights of fantasy, and of course, Redgrave pulls it all off with sterling style.

Natasha Richardson - Redgrave's real daughter - plays Ann's daughter, Constance, in the film. The scenes between this real life mother and daughter playing fictional mother and daughter are an insightful treat to watch.

Toni Collette plays Ann's other daughter, Nina. Nina spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while shutting out a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for a part such as this, but I have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she plays.

Mamie Gummer plays 1950's Lila and shows us a woman even more conflicted of her expected role in life than her good friend, Ann. She is very good.

Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - plays present day Lila. What is there to say about Meryl Streep other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance.

Director Lajos Koltai states in the DVD extras that he sought out Glenn Close to play the relatively small part of Lila's mother because he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film. He certainly was right, and Close's performance in that one scene etches it in your mind. All the other scenes in which Close is Lila's very proper mother, and you get another performance to treasure.

There are three other scenes in the film, combined with the one featuring Close described above, that make the whole movie worth watching. On Lila's wedding day, Ann comes into her room and crawls into to bed with her friend to discuss Lila's misforgivings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love. This scene is repeated fifty years later when Lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend Ann to talk about the lives they have lived. In this latter scene, Streep and Redgrave are enthralling.

The other memorable scene - at least to me - is when Buddy declares his love for Ann. Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings. His performance is superior.

Chick flick? Yes. A very special film with unbelievable acting, directing, and scenery? Definitely. I cannot recommend Evening too much."

"Okay, let's not get confused here. If this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic, does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classic's sequel? Here's to hoping that's not a general rule, as Wes Craven's own sequel to the original ""The Hills have Eyes""  released somewhere during the mid-80's  is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made. Part two didn't have an actual plot and re-used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise. Craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories, as the loyal German Shepard of the Carter family re-experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies. There were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well. The remake came out barely one year ago and here's the sequel already? The incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script. Don't they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary, menacing and disturbing? With his excellent film, Alexandre Aja nearly single-handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes, as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for. Also, Aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his French instant cult classic ""High Tension"", but who is this new director? Aja's ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was an unexpected hit, appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over-enthusiast target groups. It's a really good film and, even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable, it's highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of Aja's smashing hit. Bearing all this in mind, plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism, I must admit this rushed sequel really isn't as awful as anticipated. The screenplay is routine and clichéd horror fodder, introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsive-looking freaks. After the events of the first film, the US army has set up a camp in the middle of the New Mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests, which took place there in the 50's and 60's. For the horribly mutated survivors of the miner's community that stayed there during the radioactive testing, the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck. They are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines.<br /><br />This basically is just another by-the-numbers slasher with dumb characters who are, even after losing several of their friends already, still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill. It's also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive, especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3-year-old son. ""The Hills Have Eyes II"" completely lacks  as to be expected  originality, logic and plausible situations. The mutated miners aren't nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one, mainly because they aren't organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sex-hungry prototype monsters. Since you don't care for the amateur G.I. Joe ""heroes"" and definitely don't feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills, this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year's original. Most peculiarly, this second film isn't nearly as violent and gory as the first! Sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise-twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences, but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor. There are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics  mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns  but there sadly aren't any outrageous pick-axe battles or virulent dog attacks. What a shame! What's the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness and/or gratuitous filth of the original? Luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental, and you'll have the most fun spotting all the things that don't make the slightest bit of sense! For example, wallets falling out of people's bloodied heads, women without any muscle power cast as tough-ass soldiers and  my personal favorite  assigning the ONE soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications.",0,5052,True,7881,"Sure, here's a shorter version of the review:

If this sequel to a remake of an original horror classic is also a remake of the sequel, let's hope it's not a general rule. Wes Craven's sequel to ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" released in the mid-80s, was one of the worst horror movies, lacking plot and re-using footage. Craven even suggested that dogs have flashbacks. The rushed release of the new sequel raises quality concerns. Alexandre Aja's remake was a hit, appreciated by horror fans of all ages, altering opinions on remakes with its gore and plot changes. Aja, known for ""High Tension,"" is talented, but the new director is unknown. Despite skepticism, the sequel isn't as bad as feared. The script is clichéd, with characters lacking depth, getting slaughtered by freaks. The army investigates nuclear test sites, facing mutated miners. The film is a by-the-numbers slasher with dumb characters acting as easy targets. It's predictable who survives, with one soldier against violence and another focused on her son. The sequel lacks originality, logic, and menace, unlike its predecessor. The miners aren't organized and behave like prototype monsters. The film isn't violent or gory, unlike the first. Sequels usually add bloodshed, but this one's action is tame. There are scenes for horror fans, but no outrageous battles. The film isn't boring, and it's fun spotting things that make no sense, like wallets falling from heads and a soldier with a speaking disability on radio duty."
"This is indeed quite the strange movie... First, we have an ex-U.S.-gymnast trying to turn actor (or something), and this seems to be the only role he ever got (that I know of anyway) -- and for good reason. While he does pull off the role well enough to keep some interest, it is a rather bland and flat performance. Second, we have the WORST EVER sound effects ever used in a movie!!! I'm not kidding. This alone makes the movie extremely comical, but in that annoying way. hehe And third, while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast (including the required hot chick!), an actually not-so-bad story, and some cool visuals; the dialogue, fight scenes involving gymnastics (hilarious!), and overall execution of the plot are weak.

It really stood out in an era crowded with detective shows, offering something unique and refreshing. The concept of a blind detective may not be totally new, but it added so much depth and intrigue to the story. It brought a fresh perspective to the genre, challenging the traditional tropes and delivering something truly distinct. And who could forget Pax, the beautiful guide dog in the series! Pax was not just a companion but an integral part of the storytelling, adding an emotional layer that resonated with viewers. Pax's presence on screen was both comforting and inspiring, providing a unique dynamic to the detective's character and the narrative as a whole.

Whilst the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series, the settings in New Orleans, the acting, and the music all worked together to make a good television series even better! The vibrant and mysterious backdrop of New Orleans added a rich texture to the narrative, with its unique culture and atmosphere enhancing each episode. The acting was commendable, bringing authenticity and depth to each character, making them relatable and memorable. The music, as noted in other comments, was particularly outstanding. I remember that clearly, and it played a crucial role in setting the tone and mood for each scene, elevating the overall experience of the show. The score was both haunting and beautiful, perfectly complementing the series' themes and enhancing the viewing experience.

Well, you never know... one day, Paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on DVD! This would be a fantastic opportunity for new audiences to discover and appreciate this hidden gem of a series. It truly deserves to be revisited and enjoyed by a wider audience, allowing it to finally find the recognition and appreciation it merits. Such a release would not only satisfy longtime fans eager to relive the series' magic but also introduce its unique charm to a new generation of viewers. Here's hoping that one day, this exceptional show will be available for everyone to enjoy and celebrate."
"OK, I normally don't add comments on movies, but I finally watched a movie that was so utterly full of bullsh*t and riddled with incompetence that I just had to warn people about. Blackwater Valley Exorcist is loosely about a wife-beating/pederast/priest and this podunk family of horse freaks, and to make a long story short the youngest daughter who was molested by the priest but in love with the hillbilly ranch hand gets possessed.

Brooks, known for his work on films like ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""As Good As It Gets,"" and it features a truly exceptional cast, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks, and Holly Hunter. Each of them delivers a strong performance, showcasing their acting prowess, but unfortunately, their characters are all too unlikable to really make the audience care about them on a deeper level.

There are several parts of the film that are truly brilliant and stand out, such as the engaging prologue, which sets the stage for the story, and the short but memorable scenes featuring Jack Nicholson, who adds his own unique touch to the film. However, the main reason the movie doesn't entirely work is that it relies heavily on the characters being amusing in and of themselves, rather than amusing things actually happening to them, which can sometimes feel like a missed opportunity for more engaging storytelling.

While you could consider ""Broadcast News"" to be nothing more than a drama, it often veers into silliness, which prevents it from being entirely successful in that genre as well. Despite these shortcomings, the script's cleverness and wit make it worth a watch, as it offers an interesting take on the world of broadcast journalism and the personal and professional challenges the characters face. However, it's important to note that this film is certainly not for everyone, as its unique blend of drama and humor may not appeal to all audiences.

Overall, ""Broadcast News"" is a film that has its moments of brilliance and showcases the talents of its cast and director, but it ultimately falls short of being a complete success due to the unlikable nature of its characters and its somewhat inconsistent tone. Nevertheless, it remains an intriguing watch for those who appreciate a well-crafted script and nuanced performances. 7.0 out of 10."
"1st watched 12/24/2009  4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas fluff that doesn't really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factual-based incident of a man who is wrongly put in jail trying to get a job for his family to make Christmas happen for them. The three kids in the family then run away from home on a trek to Washington D.C. to enlist the then President of the United States, Herbert Hoover. This trek provides some side stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer, which makes the story kind of like a Disney ""animals on the run"" movie and doesn't quite fit here. At the ending, there isn't any details given as to how the President helped the family and this is another downpoint to the movie, in my opinion.

"It occurred to me while the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of Buddy Holly's death that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in Clearlake, Iowa who remember it vividly. That has to be a haunting memory, lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of ""American Pie"", as it pays tribute to the day the music died.

I found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line, and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience, far more often than I found myself enjoying the movie. The attempts to engage or surprise the viewer fell flat, as they were telegraphed well in advance of their actual occurrence. It felt as though the filmmakers underestimated the intelligence of the audience, assuming that even the most obvious plot twists would somehow catch us off guard. Instead, the film became an exercise in endurance, as I waited for the predictable events to unfold just as I had foreseen them.

In conclusion, Wargames: The Dead Code fails to deliver on any promise of intrigue or suspense, instead serving up a series of telegraphed plot points that leave the audience disengaged and amused for all the wrong reasons. The lack of subtlety and intelligence in the storytelling makes it difficult to immerse oneself in the film, turning what could have been an enjoyable experience into a predictable and forgettable one."
"When the long running 'Happy Ever After' came to an end, its characters- 'Terry & June Fletcher' were revived for the longer running and more popular sequel- 'Terry & June', although their surnames were changed from Fletcher to Medford.<br /><br />Terry has received a new job and as a result, he and June move to Purley where they end up in all manner of scrapes- unwanted guests dropping by to visit at an inconvenient moment, the boss inviting himself to dinner and Terry trying to chance his arm at D.I.Y but cocking it up each time. A fellow IMDb user branded this show as 'not clever' and 'never well written'. Fair enough, it wasn't clever, but that was the whole point. As for 'never well written'- some of the episodes were pretty substandard, I will admit, but overall I found it to be extremely well written, highly amusing and very well acted.<br /><br />It was warm hearted slapstick, not dissimilar to the later B.B.C sitcom 'Keeping Up Appearances'. Eight different writers contributed to the nine series, giving the show plenty of scope. Terry Scott was a comic genius, as he well proved in productions such as 'Hugh & I', the 'Carry On' films and of course, here! June Whitfield likewise was a comedy legend in her own right.<br /><br />I enjoy some modern shows- i.e 'Still Game', 'The Catherine Tate Show', 'Legit' and 'Empty'. I even enjoyed the 'alternative comedy'- 'Naked Video', 'The Young Ones' and 'The Comic Strip Presents' but I am more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy, such as this.

Terry gets a new job, and they move to Purley, getting into scrapes like unwanted guests, the boss inviting himself to dinner, and Terry's failed DIY attempts. A fellow IMDb user called it 'not clever' and 'never well written'. While it wasn't clever, that was the point. Some episodes were substandard, but overall it was well-written, amusing, and well-acted. It was warm-hearted slapstick, like 'Keeping Up Appearances'. Eight writers contributed to the nine series, giving it scope. Terry Scott was a comic genius, as seen in 'Hugh & I', the 'Carry On' films, and here. June Whitfield was a comedy legend. I enjoy some modern shows like 'Still Game', 'The Catherine Tate Show', 'Legit', and 'Empty', and even 'alternative comedy' like 'Naked Video', 'The Young Ones', and 'The Comic Strip Presents', but I prefer vintage comedy like this. Humour you don't need to think about is great for lifting your spirits. 'Terry & June' was wonderful, with a catchy theme tune that matched the show's mood well!"

Music. Revolutions, artistic, cultural, personal. A legacy with powerful consequences and endless ramifications. He introduced the neorealism through the work of an American novelist James Cain in ""Ossesione."" Visconti's contribution to the arts is monumental and his influence can be seen across various mediums. He gave Anna Magnani the most extraordinarily beautiful close-ups of her career, capturing her emotional depth and intensity in a way that was both raw and breathtaking. His ability to draw out such powerful performances from his actors is part of what made him a master of his craft. He gave us Alain Delon, whose enigmatic presence and striking looks became a hallmark of Visconti's films, and Maria Callas, whose operatic talents were showcased in a manner that highlighted her dramatic flair and vocal prowess. But the last word about his life and work rests on the talents of a certain Adam Low and the voice of Helmut Berger, an actor closely associated with Visconti's work and personal life. What a terrible fate, it seems, for such a visionary artist's legacy to be encapsulated by others, yet it is perhaps a testament to the enduring impact he had on those around him.

For those interested, there is a 61-minute documentary by director Carlo Lizzani, a man who really knew Visconti and understood the nuances of his character and artistry. Titled ""LUCHINO VISCONTI: A PORTRAIT,"" this documentary offers an intimate glimpse into the life and mind of a director whose works continue to inspire and provoke thought. It is out on DVD, distributed by Image Entertainment, providing an accessible way for enthusiasts and newcomers alike to delve deeper into the world of Visconti. Through Lizzani's direction, viewers can gain insights into Visconti's creative process, his influences, and the indelible mark he left on the world of cinema and beyond."

"First of all, I don't understand why some people find this movie so anti-american. Sure, there are moments when the U.S. are accused directly, like at the segments of Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Nair. But come on, they aren't naive accusations; instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all the documents that the CIA released about Chile confirms this, for example.<br /><br />But returning to the film itself, what I enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it. We find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event; we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to this, with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness.<br /><br />All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of September 11th. Thus, what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks, and this may make some people infuriated; but this is the world where we live, and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies, regardless of what presidents or priests may say us.<br /><br />Finally, I think it's a shame that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the United States of America. It's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened, and this movie could give some clues to them.

"I basically picked up this movie because I had seen Kitano Takashi's brilliant remake of Zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai tale which also starred Asano Tadanobu. These two movies are worlds apart. Zatoichi added humor and depth to its characters and subverted traditional samurai movie clichés. Gojoe goes off the deep end in the other direction.<br /><br />First off, I hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie. ""You cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior"" says almost every character in Benkei's presence, yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself. Instead of character development, we get bloated, boring, gory battle scenes. Asano's character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and doesn't know what he is doing there. I know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of Asano's appeal, but this movie doesn't serve him.<br /><br />A lot of the camera movement is nauseating. There is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera spins around the main characters until my wife and I felt like vomiting. The ending is ridiculous and rather anti-climatic. <br /><br />Its too bad that really good samurai movies aren't being made in Japan nowadays with this type of budget. The colors, scenery, and costumes were great, but the rest is just a loooong waste of time. I would rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth.",0,1543,True,1390,"I picked up this movie after enjoying Kitano Takashi's Zatoichi and wanted another updated samurai tale starring Asano Tadanobu.

I dislike movies that rely on other characters to inform us about the protagonist instead of developing the character throughout the film. ""You cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior,"" says nearly everyone to Benkei, yet this inner turmoil is barely shown. Instead, we get bloated, boring, gory battle scenes. Asano's character lacks development, and even he looks bored and unsure of his role. His usual distant coolness doesn't suit this movie.

"**SPOILERS** Beautifully photographed slice of life home-front WWII love story with Norman Rockwell paintings in the beginning and end of the movie about how a ""war hero"" is not just someone who kills for his country but is also someone who thinks for himself and isn't corrupted by the war propaganda that's constantly drummed into his head.

That's what being in the Marine Corps and WWII did to him! Buying Hedge a number of drinks Richard takes the drunk Baby Blue outside and knocks him out taking his Baby Blues and leaves his impressive US Marine uniform with some money in it for Hedge to ware. <br /><br />As soon as Hedge puts on Richard's uniform, that fits him perfectly, he's confronted by this big drunken US paratrooper who calls himself Cement-Head wanting to have a fist fight with the Marine Raider. Hedge doing everything he can to avoid trouble is forced by Cement-Head to belt him, after he himself cracked two beer bottle over his cement-head, to get himself warmed up for the big bout between Marine,Hedge, and Paratrooper, Cement-Head. Hedge incredibly floors the big cement headed buffoon knocking him out cold with one punch! ""I guess the trick is not hitting him in on top of his head"" a stunned Hedge tell his, Cement-Heads, fellow G.I's.<br /><br />Hitch-hiking to this small town of Bidwell Hedge notices this US Military internment camp for Japanese-Americans who are there because their considered a threat to US security. It's later in the movie that Hedge shows everyone what a real hero he is, not who the people in the town think he is, by risking his life to save one of the hated ""Japs"" who mindlessly together with two of his friends escaped from the interment camp, where the hell did they think they were going anyway? Hedge risked his life by saving the scared to death Japanese-American from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the town. Hedge in his actions taught the people of Bidwell that not all ""Japs"", even those who are American citizens, are bad and treacherous banzai screaming suicidal kamikazes like they were thought by the newspapers magazines and movies at the time to think that they were.<br /><br />Hedge strikes up a conversation with the very cute and pretty waitress at the local diner Rose Hudkins, Glynnis O'Connor,who's just crazy about him that even Hedge at first thinks that it's his uniform not him that impressed her. Later when Hedge admits to Rose that he's not what she and her parents think,A US Marine Raider,that he is Rose had by then gotten to know the sweet and caring washed-out marine so well that it didn't matter to her at all what he was supposed to be, a Marine a Paratrooper or a Post Office worker, it was what was inside his heart that really counted.<br /><br />The film has a number of touching and beautiful scenes in it between Hedge and Rose that shows how movies used to be made years ago without all the sex and profanity that we see and hear in movies today that involved two people in love with each other.<br /><br />The way the film accurately, not phony baloney, shows the true feelings of average Americans, back then in 1943, about the war in general and Japanese in particular couldn't have been done in more authentic and accurate as well as good taste. ""Baby Blur Marine"" does it's best not to be too politically correct in not showing the hero's or leading actors and actresses in the film having the same feelings and ideas back then during WWII as most people have now, which would have come across as phony as a three dollar bill, to those people watching the film who lived during those historic and momentous times when the film was to take place.",1,4559,True,38249,"**SPOILERS** Beautifully photographed slice of life home-front WWII love story with Norman Rockwell paintings in the beginning and end.

"As it turns out, Chris Farley and David Spade only made three movies together (""Coneheads"", ""Tommy Boy"" and ""Black Sheep""), but this was truly the ""Citizen Kane"" of their pairings. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, the dimwitted heir to an auto parts company. His father Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) hires mild-mannered Richard Hayden (David Spade) to look after him. Big Tom is getting married to a ""ten"" (Bo Derek), so everything has to be in order. After Big Tom suddenly dies, Tommy and Richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy. From then on, the movie is pretty much an excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best: make a mess of everything.<br /><br />When this movie first came out in the theaters, I saw it with my grandfather. He figured out early on that the Bo Derek and Rob Lowe characters were hiding something. But you can completely ignore that and simply luxuriate in Chris Farley's antics. Nothing is safe around his stomach, and hell hath no fury like his happy-go-lucky attitude. The scene where he sets the cars on fire, and later the deer scene, make for a pure laugh riot.

Do not bother watching this film. Nothing is said here that hasn't already been covered many, many times over in previous movies. The plot is predictable, and the characters are one-dimensional. I will say this, however; it's about a hundred times better than ""Failure To Launch,"" which isn't saying much considering how low the bar is set by that particular film. There are very few amusing bits in this movie, unless, of course, you find Eli Wallach cursing to be funny. Ha, Ha! He's old and he dropped the f-bomb! Tee, hee, hee. It's supposed to be comedic gold, but instead, it's just pitiful!

The pacing drags, the jokes fall flat, and the storyline lacks any real depth or originality. The film tries to capitalize on the charm of its cast, but even their combined talents can't save it from mediocrity. It's a shame because the premise had potential, but the execution is severely lacking. The film ultimately feels like a rehash of tired tropes and clichés, offering nothing fresh or innovative to the audience. So, if you're considering watching this movie, I would advise against it. There are far better options out there that are more deserving of your time and attention."

After completing a hit, he hitches a ride with a struggling American writer and his Mexican girlfriend. This unlikely trio embarks on a journey that takes them toward the border. The hit-man offers them money to facilitate his escape to the border, but as often happens in such stories, things rapidly spiral out of control.

The movie begins with a promising setup, capturing the audience's attention with its intriguing premise and the potential for an engaging storyline. However, it quickly loses momentum, struggles to maintain interest, and ultimately fizzles out, leaving viewers wanting more substance and depth.

**SPOILER**

The narrative takes a turn with an eventual relationship twist that is poorly established, making it challenging for the audience to suspend disbelief. The lack of palpable passion and the absence of a convincing rationale for the girlfriend's decision to leave one man for another render this plot point absurd. The execution falls flat, and the climax of the story becomes predictable and unexciting, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction.

**END SPOILER**

Adding to the film's potential was Harvey Keitel's role as the U.S. agent on the hit-man's trail. However, even his performance seems to suffer from the constraints of a script that is both boring and slow-paced. Keitel, usually a captivating presence on screen, appears somewhat bewildered by the lackluster material he has to work with, further highlighting the film's shortcomings."

Yet, somehow this particular gathering of family and ""family by association"" in a small, non-descript house in Buffalo more than fits the bill. If you've never been to Buffalo, you'll leave the theater with thoughts of ""shuffling off"" for a visit!

If only more movies would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country's ""second cities"" instead of running off to a soundstage somewhere, the end results would be so much more believable.<br /><br />Great performances by Shirley Jones, Frank Gorshin, Wendy Malick, Jill Eickenberry, and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent outlasts Hollywood's ""flavor of the week"" any time!<br /><br />GO SEE THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />You've wandered in Hollywood's desert for too long!",1,1841,True,48394,"In the wasteland that Hollywood Productions have become of late, this movie is truly ""MANNA FROM HEAVEN""!!!

"Annie Potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film.

Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really, really, really upset that someone stole the Corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod (quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie), and heads off to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy. The film attempts to capture the excitement of a high-stakes adventure, but unfortunately, it falls flat in most aspects. The plot is thin, and the characters are not developed enough to engage the audience. Mark Hamill, known for his iconic role as Luke Skywalker, seems out of place in this film. His portrayal of the distraught teenager lacks depth and emotion, making it difficult for viewers to connect with his character's plight. The chemistry between Hamill and Potts is somewhat charming, but it is not enough to save the film from its overall mediocrity.

The car, which is supposed to be the centerpiece of the story, fails to impress. Its design is more of an eyesore than an object of desire, making it hard to believe that anyone would go to such lengths to retrieve it. Despite the film's shortcomings, Annie Potts shines in her role, bringing energy and charisma to the screen. Her performance is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise lackluster movie. It's evident that Potts has a natural talent for acting, and her presence elevates the film, even if only slightly. It's too bad for Hamill that he didn't take a few acting lessons from her. Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo, adding a brief moment of humor to the film. However, even his appearance is not enough to make the movie memorable.

In the end, the film is a missed opportunity. It could have been a fun and exciting adventure, but it ultimately fails to deliver on its promise. The poor script, combined with lackluster performances, makes for a forgettable movie experience. If it weren't for Annie Potts, there would be little reason to watch this film at all. Her performance is the only saving grace in an otherwise dull and uninspired production. I would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasn't for the fun of watching Annie Potts in a very early role. While the film may hold some nostalgia for those who remember it from its initial release, it doesn't stand the test of time and is unlikely to win over new fans."

"What the hell of a D-Movie was that? Bad acting, bad special effects and the worst dialogues/storyline i ever came across. The only cool thing here was Coolio, who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop. However, the rest of the film is awful and boring. It's not even so bad, you can laugh about it. Just plain crap.

I honestly can't believe what I just watched. It was an absolute disaster from start to finish. Bad acting, bad special effects, and the worst dialogues/storyline I have ever come across. The performances were so wooden and unconvincing that I found myself cringing at every scene. The special effects were laughably poor, lacking any kind of creativity or effort, and the storyline was just a complete mess. It was incoherent and seemed like it was thrown together without any thought or planning.

The only cool thing here was Coolio, who had a nice cameo as a freaked-out cop. His brief appearance was the only moment of relief in an otherwise unbearable film. However, the rest of the film is awful and boring. There was nothing engaging or entertaining about it. It failed to hold my attention, and I found myself constantly checking the time, hoping it would end soon.

It's not even so bad, you can laugh about it. Some movies are so bad that they become entertaining, but this wasn't one of them. It was just plain crap. There was no redeeming quality, no moments of unintended comedy that could make the experience somewhat enjoyable.

And whoever compares this to the Evil Dead Series might as well compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (well, ok, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! The comparison is completely unfounded and frankly insulting to the brilliance of the Evil Dead Series. There is simply no comparison. This film lacks the charm, wit, and creativity that made the Evil Dead Series a cult classic.

In conclusion, this film is an absolute trainwreck. I would not recommend it to anyone. It's a waste of time, and you're better off watching something else. 1 out of 10."

Nothing good, a lot that's mediocre.",0,332,False,29089,"In a TV-movie 70's kind of way, this film offers a nostalgic trip back to an era where storytelling was simpler and often a bit cheesy, yet charming in its own right. It's the kind of movie that tends to make an occasional appearance in the wee hours of the night, typically when you're flipping through channels and stumble upon it by chance. However, it doesn't show up too frequently, as it's often overshadowed by more modern late-hour schlock movies that tend to bump it off the schedule. Despite its rarity, when you do catch it, you'll find it has a certain appeal, largely due to the likeable performances by the cast, particularly Graves and Wynn. They bring a warmth to their roles that makes the film enjoyable, even if it's not particularly memorable.

Generally speaking, it's just a harmless little piece of nothing that doesn't offend too badly. There's nothing in it that stands out as particularly noteworthy or exceptional, but at the same time, there's nothing that will make you regret watching it. It's a film that sits comfortably in the realm of mediocrity, with nothing particularly good to offer, but a lot that falls squarely into the category of mediocre. It's the kind of movie you might watch while winding down at the end of the day, appreciating it for what it is—a simple, uncomplicated viewing experience that doesn't demand too much from its audience. In the grand scheme of things, it may not leave a lasting impression, but for a brief moment, it provides a gentle escape into a bygone era."

Unlike many who face such adversity, he managed to rise above his difficulties and become a respectable and admirable person. What's even more inspiring is that this is a true story, making the film even more compelling and impactful for the audience.

Antwone Fisher is portrayed with an innocence that starkly contrasts the severe abuse he endured, often solely because of his race. His resilience and strength in the face of such adversity are truly remarkable and moving. Despite the numerous challenges he faced, Antwone Fisher has been happily married to the same woman for ten years, showcasing his commitment and loyalty. He is a man of integrity who never succumbed to the temptations that surrounded him throughout his life. He avoided the pitfalls of fooling around with women, and he steered clear of cocaine, cigars, weed, alcohol, and other vices that were prevalent in the environment where he was raised. His ability to maintain his principles in such challenging circumstances is truly admirable.

There is so much to admire and learn from in this movie that it leaves a lasting impression on its viewers. It is a powerful testament to the strength of the human spirit and the ability to overcome even the most daunting obstacles. The movie's portrayal of Antwone Fisher's life is both heart-wrenching and inspiring, providing a deep and insightful look into the struggles and triumphs of an extraordinary individual.

There is not much more to say about this movie other than it is excellent. The storytelling, acting, and direction all come together to create a truly exceptional film. The only rating I can give it is a 10/10, as it thoroughly deserves such high praise for its outstanding portrayal of an incredible true story."

The film manages to capture the essence of the era while delivering an engaging experience that keeps the audience intrigued. The atmosphere is thick with suspense, and the character development, though not perfect, adds depth to the unfolding story. The tension builds slowly, drawing viewers in with a sense of unease as the narrative progresses. 

While there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly, the fact that she's a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story, adding layers to her character and providing insight into her psyche. This element of the plot intertwines with the overall theme, creating a more cohesive narrative. There's one scene with the curly-haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad, showcasing the film's ability to balance sensuality with psychological tension. This scene, in particular, stands out for its raw emotional intensity and the way it plays with audience expectations.

The young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself, and I'm not surprised she posed for the cover of Playboy. Her presence adds another layer of allure to the film, and her interactions with the other characters contribute to the movie's dynamic. Her character's journey adds an intriguing subplot that complements the main storyline. Some characters are very irritating, which might be intentional to heighten the sense of chaos and unpredictability within the narrative. Their presence adds to the film's unsettling atmosphere, making it difficult to predict what might happen next. 

Some scenes do seem ridiculous, but they are part of the charm that makes this B-movie memorable. These moments of absurdity provide a counterbalance to the horror, offering brief respites from the tension. For the most part, however, Don't Look in the Basement (That's the title I saw on YouTube) provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining B-movie. It stands as a testament to the creativity and resourcefulness of filmmakers working within the constraints of a limited budget, proving that a strong concept and effective storytelling can overcome financial limitations. Overall, this hidden gem from the '70s delivers a unique blend of drama and horror that is both entertaining and thought-provoking, making it well worth a watch for fans of the genre."

Perhaps if the only Chinese movies you've seen contained no dialogue, long drawn-out far-away stares and silences, and hack editing, then you're spot on. I really wanted to enjoy this film, but it was impossible given the overwhelming flaws that seem to dominate every scene. The pacing was incredibly slow, and the lack of engaging dialogue made it feel as though the movie was dragging on forever. 

Complicated story-line? Hardly. Try juvenile and amateurish. It felt as though the plot was thrown together without any real thought or creativity. The supposed depth and intricacy were nowhere to be found, leaving me feeling frustrated and utterly disappointed. Exquisite moods and haunting memories? Hardly. Try flat-out boring and trite. The film failed to evoke any emotional response, and the attempts at creating an atmospheric experience fell flat. The characters were one-dimensional, and it was impossible to connect with them on any level.

This was awful. I could not wait for it to be over. Particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of ""How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yes."" Wow! What depth of character. The dialogue was painfully simplistic, and I was left wondering how anyone could consider this to be a masterpiece. The film's reliance on minimal conversation and heavy silence did not contribute to any sense of mystery or intrigue. I guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them. It seemed as though the filmmakers were trying to use visual cues to compensate for the lack of meaningful dialogue, but it simply did not work.

As a huge fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was totally disappointed in this. Even Zhang's sentimentally sappy ""The Road Home"" was better than this. There are so many incredible films from these regions that offer rich storytelling and captivating performances, but this was certainly not one of them. I expected so much more based on the glowing reviews, but what I got was a tedious and uninspired film that left me feeling utterly let down."

Very impressive screenplay and comedic acting and timing in this film. Now 40 years old, it has lost none of its power. Neil Simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations. The ability to delve into the intricacies of human interaction and extract humor from the most unexpected circumstances is a testament to Simon's genius as a playwright and screenwriter. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedic performances. Their on-screen chemistry is nothing short of remarkable, as they effortlessly bring to life the characters originally crafted by Simon. Their timing, expressions, and delivery are a masterclass in comedic acting. Neil Simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based on. This personal connection to the material perhaps adds an extra layer of authenticity and depth to the narrative, making it resonate with audiences even decades later.

One of the best written and acted Hollywood comedies of all time! The combination of an expertly crafted script and outstanding performances makes this film a standout in the genre. Surprisingly, only nominated for 2 Academy Awards: ""Best Adapted Screenplay"" and ""Best Film Editing"". Hollywood rarely awards comedies, no matter how well they are made. It's a curious phenomenon that despite the undeniable skill and artistry required to create a successful comedy, such films often go unrecognized in major award ceremonies. This film's limited nominations serve as a reminder of the industry's historical bias against comedies, highlighting the need for a broader appreciation of the genre."
"Beautiful film set in 1962 Hong Kong about a man (Mr. Chow) and woman (Mrs. Chan) who become close friends when they suspect their spouses are having an affair. Stylistically, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses a lot of slow motion and close-ups on parts of the body (feet, hands, waist). The film itself has a reticence and properness that suggests its time period. It's sexy without showing everything. Wong Kar-Wai also doesn't allow the audience to see what the spouses look like, suggesting that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan should be together. Smoking is even made to look elegant with close-ups of the curls of smoke. A really lovely film. Just prepare yourself for the ending.<br /><br />",1,701,False,48809,"Beautiful film set in 1962 Hong Kong about a man named Mr. Chow and a woman named Mrs. Chan who become close friends when they begin to suspect that their respective spouses are having an affair. This film, directed by Wong Kar-Wai, is stunning both in its narrative and its stylistic execution. The filmmaker employs a lot of slow motion and close-ups on parts of the body, such as feet, hands, and the waist, to create an intimate and immersive atmosphere. The film itself carries a sense of reticence and properness that perfectly suggests its time period, capturing the essence of 1960s Hong Kong with remarkable attention to detail. It manages to be incredibly sexy without overtly showing everything, relying instead on suggestion and subtlety to convey deep emotional and physical connections. Wong Kar-Wai also makes the bold choice not to allow the audience to see what the spouses look like, which cleverly suggests that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan are meant to be together, emphasizing their growing bond. Even smoking is made to look elegant and sophisticated, with close-ups of the delicate curls of smoke enhancing the film's aesthetic allure. The entire experience is a really lovely film that captivates the senses and the emotions. Just prepare yourself for the ending, as it is both poignant and unexpected."
"John Water's (""Pink Flamingos""...) ""Pecker"" is the best movie I've seen in a while. It gives the viewer a surreal image of life in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington, DC), with a Warhol-like use of color, exaggerated motions and emotions. Pecker becomes larger than his town can handle, and he is separated from his loved-ones (including a sexy Ricci) by his man-loving art manager. The picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth--kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day--and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic, it only made the whole thing more profound and critical. It is a celebration of life, liberty, and the right to bear arms...and everything else this country stands for. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)",1,764,False,17820,"John Water's (""Pink Flamingos""...)

Pecker becomes larger than his town can handle, and he is separated from his loved-ones (including a sexy Ricci) by his man-loving art manager.

"Bizarre take on the Cinderella tale. Terribly poor script, but Kathleen Turner turns in a pretty decent evil step-mother performance.<br /><br />Visually stunning in some parts, but that's about it.

Terribly poor script, but Kathleen Turner turns in a pretty decent evil step-mother performance. From the very beginning, the plot seems to be all over the place, lacking coherence and failing to capture the essence of the Cinderella story we all know and love. The dialogue, unfortunately, does not add any depth or intrigue, leaving much to be desired in terms of character development and emotional engagement. The storyline meanders through various subplots that do not contribute meaningfully to the central narrative, making it a challenge to stay invested in the unfolding events. 

Visually stunning in some parts, but that's about it. The film occasionally delivers breathtaking visuals, particularly in the grand ballroom scenes and the enchanting forest sequences, which provide brief moments of visual respite. The period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s, creating a confusing and anachronistic aesthetic that distracts rather than enhances the viewing experience. While some costume designs are impressive and intricately detailed, others seem hastily put together, further contributing to the film's overall inconsistency. Fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivel. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of dull and predictable scenes that fail to build momentum or suspense. The occasional sparks of creativity and innovation are overshadowed by the overwhelming mediocrity of the script and direction.

If you're really in the mood for a Cinderella story - I suggest ""Ever After: A Cinderella Story"" or ""The Glass Slipper"". These films offer a more cohesive narrative and compelling performances that stay true to the enchanting spirit of the classic fairy tale. ""Ever After: A Cinderella Story"" provides a refreshing and modern twist on the traditional narrative, with strong character portrayals and a well-crafted script. ""The Glass Slipper,"" on the other hand, delivers a charming and whimsical interpretation that captures the magic and wonder of the Cinderella story. In comparison, these alternatives provide a much more satisfying and enjoyable viewing experience, ensuring that the timeless tale of Cinderella continues to captivate audiences of all ages."

However, it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed just about people on a train. There was no hidden meaning or complex symbolism, just people going about their day as they traveled from one place to another. The interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street, ordinary and mundane, lacking any real excitement or intrigue. It felt as though the film was trying to hold up a mirror to everyday life, showing us the kinds of interactions we might have ourselves or witness in passing, but without adding anything new or insightful to the mix. When, on occasion, there is a slightly more interesting situation, the dialogue becomes stilted and boring, failing to capture the emotional depth or complexity that might have been present in real life. It's not that I don't get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact; I do understand that it's aiming for realism and authenticity. Yet, in this film, they are very boring, lacking any spark or dynamism that would make their stories worth telling or watching.

It has a plot that is so engaging and well-crafted that till the very end of the movie, you don't know how this is gonna end. It keeps you guessing, second-guessing, and theorizing about what might happen next, and when you think you've figured it out, it throws another curveball your way. It has characters that are so well-developed and portrayed by skilled actors like Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland, and Ben Kingsley, who are just perfect in their roles.

This movie just won't let you go away before you've seen the end of it, it demands your attention and rewards it with a satisfying conclusion.

Though there are only a few characters, I didn't find it difficult to keep my attention on the story. In fact, the limited number of characters allows for a more focused and intimate narrative that draws you in and keeps you invested in their fates. And as for the story, it's basic in the best way possible. It's not too Tom Clancy-difficult, with overly complicated plots and subplots that are hard to follow, but simple and raw, yet effective. It's realistic, grounding the thrilling events in a believable context that makes the stakes feel all the more real.

It's a testament to the power of good storytelling and the impact of strong performances, making it a must-see for any thriller enthusiast."

It presents a dramatized version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin bravely rebelled against their officers of the oppressive Tsarist regime. This historical event was a significant moment in the lead-up to the Russian Revolution, and the film captures the spirit of rebellion and the fight for justice.

The film is not just a retelling of historical events but a textbook example of cinema as an art form and a masterpiece of creative editing. It is particularly renowned for the famous Odessa Steps sequence, a powerful scene in which innocent civilians are violently mown down during the bloodshed. This sequence is a masterclass in editing; the happenings of a single minute are drawn out into five intense and suspenseful minutes through frenzied cross-cutting. This technique heightens the emotional impact and creates a sense of chaos and urgency that has rarely been matched in cinematic history.

The Battleship Potemkin contains an impressive 1,300 separate shots, a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of its creators. In both 1948 and 1958, the film was judged the best film ever made by a panel of international critics, a recognition that underscores its lasting significance and influence in the world of cinema.

The Battleship Potemkin is in the public domain in some parts of the world, allowing new generations to experience its groundbreaking storytelling and technical achievements. Its availability ensures that its legacy continues, inspiring filmmakers and audiences alike with its powerful depiction of courage and the struggle for freedom."

The movie is based on a novel by Ernest Haycock, who also wrote the novel Stagecoach, which was made into a movie of the same name in 1939, and remade in 1966 and again in 1986. The 1939 version of Stagecoach, is in my mind, one of the best movies ever made. Anyway, as for Abilene Town, my vote is a 3/10. The pacing was just not up to par, making it a challenge to stay engaged throughout its runtime. The storyline seemed to drag without delivering any significant twists or turns that could have spiced things up. The disjointed nature of the scenes contributed to the overall lack of coherence, leaving the viewer with a sense of dissatisfaction. Randolph Scott, despite being the headliner, couldn't lift the film out of mediocrity, and Lloyd Bridges, although a talented actor, didn't have much to work with in this particular script. Edgar Buchanan stood out as he often does, bringing his signature charm and humor that provided much-needed relief from the otherwise tedious narrative. His experience in the western genre shines through, making his performance a highlight. Ann Dvorak also delivered a commendable performance as Rita, adding a touch of elegance and depth to her character. However, these performances alone weren't enough to salvage the film. Ernest Haycock, who penned the original novel, is known for his work on Stagecoach, a story that has been successfully adapted multiple times. The 1939 version of Stagecoach, in particular, stands as a classic and a benchmark in the western genre. It’s a film that expertly combines strong storytelling with dynamic characters and engaging action, making it one of the best movies ever made, in my opinion. In stark contrast, Abilene Town fails to capture that same magic. Despite the potential of its source material, the movie doesn't manage to bring the story to life in a compelling way. The elements that made Stagecoach a success seem absent here, leading to a disappointing viewing experience. Ultimately, Abilene Town earns a 3/10 from me, as it doesn't offer much to recommend beyond a couple of standout performances."

I do have some questions though, maybe I wasn't paying enough attention. The plot had so many twists and turns that it was hard to keep track of all the details. The atmosphere and tension were palpable, and the cinematography really captured the essence of the genre. However, I still find myself puzzled by a few key points that I just can't seem to wrap my head around. 

Who killed the neighbor and why? The motivations behind this act seemed unclear to me, and I wonder if I missed some crucial clue or piece of dialogue that would have explained it. It seemed like such a pivotal moment in the story, and yet I feel like I was left grasping at straws trying to understand the reasoning behind it. Similarly, who killed the replacement girl and why? This was another point of confusion for me, as the layers of deception and intrigue seemed to obscure the true motives of the characters involved. The narrative was so intricate that I found myself questioning every character's intentions, and the answer to this particular mystery seemed just out of reach.

And some minor quibbles, they should have shown the stopoff at the hotel for the switch. Not that they should have shown the switch, but they should have shown Jim and the girl going in the hotel, Jim going to the bathroom, coming out and being told by the bartender that his girlfriend went to the car without him. This would have added an extra layer of depth to the story, providing a clearer understanding of the sequence of events. 

Then, Jim getting back in the car and seeing the sleeping woman, and little girl in his back seat. This moment was pivotal, and including that hotel scene would have given the viewer a sporting chance at figuring out the solution. It would have allowed us to piece together the puzzle with a bit more clarity, giving us the opportunity to engage more deeply with the plot. 

I wish I taped it though, I'd like to see it again. There's something about the allure of a well-crafted noir mystery that makes you want to revisit it, to catch those subtle hints and clues that you may have missed the first time around. The film had a magnetic quality that drew you in, and I feel like a second viewing would provide a richer, more satisfying experience."

That pretty much sums it up ... corny. The film has an undeniable cheesiness that permeates throughout the entire narrative. MacDowell's inability to act is at times painful, leaving the audience cringing during several scenes. Her performance lacks the depth and authenticity needed to elevate the character, which detracts from the overall experience. And then there is Hurt, whose performance in this film suggests he must need money to take such muted roles. His usually dynamic presence is unfortunately subdued here, making us wonder what led him to choose this particular project. Despite these drawbacks, I still enjoyed it.

Why? In a single word, Travolta. He is GREAT in this movie. His charisma and energy bring a much-needed spark to the film, captivating the audience and providing a reason to keep watching. Travolta's performance is a standout, showcasing his talent and reminding us why he is such a beloved actor. His portrayal adds a layer of enjoyment that compensates for the movie's other shortcomings. Still, I can't give the movie too high a score, but it certainly deserves better than it seems to be getting. The film may not be perfect, but Travolta's contribution makes it worth a watch, lifting it above the mediocrity it might otherwise succumb to."
"Hammer House of Horror: Witching Time is set in rural England on Woodstock farm where stressed musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with his actress wife Mary (Prunella Gee) & is currently composing the music for a horror film. One night while looking for his dog Billy David finds a mysterious woman in his barn, calling herself Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn) she claims to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years in the past to now. Obviously rather sceptical David has a hard time believing her so he locks her in a room in his farmhouse & calls his doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to come examine her, however once he arrives & they enter the room Lucinda has disappeared. Charles puts it down to David drinking too much but over the next few day strange & disturbing things begin to happen to David & Mary...<br /><br />Witching Time was episode 1 from the short lived British anthology horror series produced by Hammer studios for TV & originally aired here in the UK during September 1980, the first of two Hammer House of Horror episodes to be directed by Don Leaver (episode 13 The Mark of Satan being the other) I actually rather liked this. As a series Hammer House of Horror dealt with various different themes & were all unconnected to each other except in name & unsurprisingly Watching Time is a sinister & effective little tale about a witch, the script by Anthony Read benefits from it's slight 50 odd minute duration & moves along at a nice pace. The character's are pretty good as is the dialogue, there are some nice scenes here & I liked the way it never quite reveals whether David & Mary are going crazy or not. I think it's a well structured, entertaining & reasonably creepy horror themed TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought I would.<br /><br />Being made for British TV meant the boys at Hammer had a lower budget than usual, if that was even possible, & as such there is no gorgeous period settings here as in their most well know Frankenstein & Dracula films although the contemporary English setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more. Another TV based restriction is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for, there's some nudity & gore but not much although I didn't mind too much as the story here is pretty good. It's well made for what it is & Hammer's experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good, the acting is good as well with genre favourite Ian McCulloch making a bit-part appearance.<br /><br />Witching Time is a good start to the Hammer House of Horror series, as a 50 minute piece of British TV it's pretty damned good, now why don't they make show's like this over here anymore?",1,2734,True,43337,"Hammer House of Horror: Witching Time is set in rural England on Woodstock farm where stressed musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with his actress wife Mary (Prunella Gee) while composing music for a horror film.

Witching Time was the first episode of the short-lived British anthology horror series by Hammer studios, airing in the UK in September 1980. Directed by Don Leaver, it's a sinister and effective tale about a witch. The script by Anthony Read benefits from its 50-minute duration and brisk pace. The characters and dialogue are solid, with scenes that keep you guessing if David and Mary are going crazy. It's a well-structured, entertaining, and reasonably creepy horror-themed TV show that surpassed my expectations.

Made for British TV, Hammer had a lower budget, lacking the period settings of their famous Frankenstein and Dracula films. However, the contemporary English setting adds relatable atmosphere. The TV restrictions mean lower exploitation levels, with some nudity and gore, but the story compensates. It's well-made, benefiting from Hammer's feature film experience, and the acting is good, with Ian McCulloch in a bit part.

Witching Time is a strong start to the Hammer House of Horror series, and as a 50-minute piece of British TV, it's impressive. Why don't they make shows like this anymore?"

I suppose the stupidity of the characters is pretty funny, so in that sense, it might make a good comedy film, but it definitely doesn't qualify as a thriller. The whole ordeal is just a mess from start to finish, with nothing redeeming about it other than the unintentional humor provided by the characters' lack of intelligence. Overall, if you're looking for a film that will thrill or scare you, this isn't the one. Instead, it might just serve as a good example of what not to do when making a creature feature."
"There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is very poor. The acting is awful, the script dire; and the special effects overrated.<br /><br />Why does Hollywood treat it's audience with such contempt? And why have they made a sequel?",0,310,False,10465,"There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. In fact, sometimes a light-hearted film can be exactly what's needed to unwind and enjoy a couple of carefree hours. It's just that some of these movies are undeniably better than others. Unfortunately, this particular film falls into the category of being very poor. The acting is awful, lacking any depth or believable emotion that might have elevated the characters beyond their one-dimensional portrayals. The script is dire, with dialogue so uninspired and clichéd that it seems like it was cobbled together from a collection of rejected lines from other movies. Furthermore, the special effects, which are often touted as a major selling point for such films, are overrated in this instance. Despite the apparent budget spent on them, they fail to impress or add any real excitement to the viewing experience.

One can't help but wonder why Hollywood continues to treat its audience with such contempt. It's as if the industry believes that viewers will accept any subpar offering simply because it is packaged as entertainment. This condescending attitude is both baffling and frustrating, especially when audiences have shown time and again that they appreciate quality storytelling and craftsmanship. And yet, despite all of these glaring issues, they have decided to make a sequel. It's perplexing to consider why the decision was made to continue a story that was so poorly executed in the first place. Perhaps they believe that the allure of a franchise is enough to draw in viewers, regardless of the lack of substance in the original material. Whatever the reason, it remains a mystery why they would choose to double down on a film that was so critically lacking."

"The film attempts to be a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--but fails in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also, the film purports to be about finding real love in Los Angeles, but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first ""big movie.""",0,402,False,6413,"The film makes an attempt to position itself as a mockumentary, which means it is shot in the documentary style but includes numerous parts that are clearly scripted. This blend of styles is intended to create a unique viewing experience; however, the film ultimately falls short of achieving its goal. One of the primary reasons for this failure is its inability to provide the audience with any compelling characters that could help create the illusion of a genuine mockumentary. Characters are essential in engaging the audience and bridging the gap between reality and fiction, but this film does not succeed in this crucial aspect. As a result, the audience is left without a point of connection or investment in the narrative. Additionally, the film claims to center on the theme of finding real love in Los Angeles, a subject that has been explored in various films and has the potential to be deeply engaging. Yet, it does not manage to delve into this theme in any meaningful or interesting way. Instead, the film devolves into an uninteresting exploration of an amateur filmmaker's attempt to make his first ""big movie."" This aspect of the story overshadows the initial premise, leaving the audience with little more than a mundane look at the trials and tribulations faced by a novice filmmaker. Consequently, the film fails to captivate or leave a lasting impression, as it strays from its purported theme and struggles to establish an authentic mockumentary style."
"being a fan of Bela Lugosi,Boris Karloff,and Lon Chaney Jr i had to see this.what tripe the only thing good about this is the clips of Lugosi,Karloff and Chaney Jr.along with all the vintage clips,that do not gel with the new black and white footage.not even close to Steve martins dead men don't wear plaid,that was done great.with all the technology we have now why was'nt this done better?if you are planning to shell out 5 bucks and some change,be warned this is really bad. but if you like Lugosi Karloff and Chaney Jr then watch their movies instead.even ed wood did better then this one.new actor mark redfield is pretty good as an imitation Bela Lugosi.the clips they use are; the ape,Mr Wong,most dangerous game,lost world,indestructible man. and devil bat.that notorious Bela Lugosi classic.i believe this production was very low budget,and it shows.1 out of 10.",0,872,False,34046,"As a devoted fan of the legendary horror icons Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Lon Chaney Jr., I felt compelled to see this film. However, I must express my deep disappointment and frustration with what I can only describe as utter tripe. The sole redeeming feature of this production is the inclusion of clips featuring the iconic performances of Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney Jr., along with various vintage clips. Unfortunately, these elements do not mesh well with the newly filmed black and white footage, which feels poorly integrated and disjointed. 

The attempt to emulate the style and success of Steve Martin's ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid,"" which masterfully combined vintage and new footage, falls miserably short in this case. Given the technological advances available to filmmakers today, it is baffling why this project was not executed with more finesse and creativity. If you are considering spending your hard-earned money—five bucks and some change—on this film, be forewarned: it is truly abysmal. Fans of Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney Jr. would be far better off revisiting their classic films, which showcase their talents far more effectively than this lackluster effort.

Even the infamous director Ed Wood managed to produce more compelling work than what is offered here. On a slightly positive note, new actor Mark Redfield delivers a fairly decent imitation of Bela Lugosi, which is a small consolation amidst the overall mediocrity. The clips included in this film are sourced from ""The Ape,"" ""Mr. Wong,"" ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" ""The Lost World,"" ""Indestructible Man,"" and ""The Devil Bat,"" the latter being a notorious Bela Lugosi classic. Unfortunately, these selections are not enough to salvage the production from its low-budget constraints, which are painfully evident throughout. 

In conclusion, I must rate this film a dismal 1 out of 10, as it fails to capture the spirit and brilliance of the horror legends it attempts to honor. If you appreciate the artistry of Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney Jr., I strongly recommend indulging in their original films instead, as they offer a far more satisfying and genuine experience."
"EL MAR is a tough, stark, utterly brilliant, brave work of cinematic art. Director Agustí Villaronga, with an adaptation by Antoni Aloy and Biel Mesquida of Blai Bonet's novel, has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives. And though the focus is on war's heinous tattoo on children, the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear. This film becomes one of the finest anti-war documents without resorting to pamphleteering: the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children's march toward adulthood.<br /><br />A small group of children are shown in the Spanish Civil War of Spain, threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens. Ramala (Nilo Mur), Tur (David Lozano), Julia (Sergi Moreno), and Francisca (Victoria Verger) witness the terror of the assassination of men, and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide. These wide-eyed children become adults, carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds.<br /><br />We then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium. Ramala (Roger Casamajor) has survived as a male prostitute, protected by his 'john' Morell (Juli Mira), and has kept his life style private. Tur (Bruno Bergonzini) has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to Catholicism and the blur of delusional self-mutilation/crucifixion. Francisca (Antònia Torrens) has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium. The three are re-joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war. Tur longs for Ramala's love, Ramala longs to be free from his Morell, and Francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nun's habit.<br /><br />The setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death, between lust and love, and between devotion and destruction is played out. To detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer, but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved (in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film) and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable. For this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and Director Villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense. The actors, both as children and as adults, are splendid: Roger Cassamoor, Bruno Bergonzini and Antònia Torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles. The cinematography by Jaime Peracaula and the haunting musical score by Javier Navarrete serve the director's vision.

"On his birthday a small boys tells his mother he is not her son, and that he wants to go home to his real mother.<br /><br />In some ways Comedy De L'Innocence feels like it comes from a different time of movie-making, perhaps the 60's or 70's.

This intriguing premise forms the core of Comedy De L'Innocence, a film that, in some ways, feels like it comes from a different era of movie-making, perhaps the 1960s or 1970s. The film certainly reminded me of Joseph Losey's Secret Ceremony (1968) and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977), both of which intricately explore themes of loss, grief, and the complex relationships between parents and 'lost' children. Curiously, both of these earlier films star Mia Farrow, adding a fascinating layer of connection between them and Comedy De L'Innocence.

All three films, including Comedy De L'Innocence, are populated with unsympathetic characters who behave in strange and often unexplained ways. This creates a sense of mystery and unease that permeates each narrative. The chilly feel, both emotionally and literally, is a common thread that runs through all three films, enhancing the atmosphere and drawing viewers into their enigmatic worlds. This emotional chilliness is mirrored in the literal cool tones of the cinematography, adding to the overall mood.

Each of these films focuses intently on mother-child relationships, delving into the depths of these bonds and the complexities that arise within them. The interactions between the characters are fraught with tension and ambiguity, leaving audiences to ponder their true nature and motivations. Ultimately, all three films pose the profound question: 'what is real, and what is imagined?' This question lingers throughout the viewing experience, challenging the audience to consider the blurred lines between reality and imagination.

Comedy De L'Innocence is beautiful yet flawed, offering no easy answers. It leaves much hanging, unexplained and strange, inviting viewers to draw their own conclusions. This lack of resolution can be both frustrating and intriguing, as it encourages deeper reflection on the themes presented. While it may not provide clear answers, the film's enigmatic nature is precisely what makes it a compelling piece of cinema."

The film follows the classic slasher formula, with a masked killer picking off the group one by one in increasingly gruesome ways. The setting is suitably isolated, heightening the tension as the characters realize they are trapped with a killer among them. The use of music from the iconic FRIDAY THE 13TH series adds an eerie familiarity, drawing comparisons between the two films.

The actors deliver performances that range from amusingly over-the-top to surprisingly earnest, adding to the fun for fans of the genre.

I think a group of first-graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this. I'm dumber for having watched it, and God have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film. It's astonishing to think that a movie like this could even be made, let alone released to the public. The experience of watching it felt like an endurance test, one that I regret subjecting myself to. Every minute that passed felt like a lifetime, and I found myself wishing for it to end from practically the very beginning. The pacing was horrendous, the dialogue was atrocious, and the entire premise was utterly ridiculous. 

And after I finally turned it off, I actually had the urge to vomit. That's how physically repulsed I was by what I had just witnessed. It was as if the movie had reached into my brain and scrambled my thoughts, leaving me feeling disoriented and slightly nauseous. I never thought a film could have such a visceral effect on me, but this one managed to do just that. It was almost impressive in its ineptitude, if it weren't so infuriating. 

No one had a clue about photography when made this. No one had a clue about acting. No one had a clue about just about anything. The cinematography was a disaster, with shots that were poorly framed and lighting that made everything look drab and lifeless. The actors, bless their hearts, seemed like they were either sleepwalking through their performances or overacting to the point of absurdity. It was a masterclass in how not to make a movie, and I wish I could unsee it. 

I can't believe F/X shows this crap on occasion. The only time I had seen it was on one of the Starz! channels - not even the main one. And it was on at about 3 a.m. at that. It's telling that it was relegated to such an obscure time slot on a lesser-known channel, as if the network itself was ashamed to air it. I can't imagine anyone willingly choosing to watch it, and I can only hope that it eventually fades into obscurity, never to torment viewers again."

Amazingly, by the end of the show, Johnny had healed entirely. It's as if the injury never happened, which is quite unrealistic and takes away from the believability of the series. Along with that, the stories on this show were nowhere near as strong as those in The Big Valley. The storytelling lacked depth and substance, which made it difficult for viewers to connect with the characters or become invested in the plotlines. This is a show that I would not want DVDs of, and frankly, I hope they are never released. I think since CBS was running out of lots, they re-used many familiar settings from other shows. This was one of the last Western series CBS produced, as Westerns were not real popular in the 1970s. The decline in popularity of Westerns during that era contributed to the show's inability to capture a substantial audience, leading to its eventual cancellation. Overall, it was a series that failed to leave a lasting impact, both in terms of storytelling and cultural significance."
"This film has its detractors, and Courtney's fey dresser may offend some folks (who, frankly, need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging, poignant, relevant.

This film truly stands out in the realm of cinema, showcasing an exemplary blend of storytelling, acting, and production design. The narrative is skillfully woven, capturing the essence of the period it portrays with meticulous attention to detail. From the very first scene, the film draws you into its world, offering a seamless blend of drama and humor that resonates long after the credits roll. The chemistry between Finney and Courtney is palpable, creating a dynamic that is both compelling and entertaining. Finney's portrayal is nothing short of magnificent, exuding charisma and depth that make his character unforgettable. Meanwhile, Courtney's performance adds a layer of complexity and wit, serving as a perfect counterbalance to Finney's larger-than-life presence. The film's ability to evoke such a wide range of emotions is a testament to its quality and the talent of everyone involved. It is a cinematic experience that deserves to be revisited time and again. The supporting cast, too, deserves recognition for their contributions, each member bringing authenticity and nuance to their roles. It is a film that not only entertains but also provokes thought, leaving a lasting impression on its audience. In every aspect, from the screenplay to the cinematography, this film excels, making it a must-see for any film enthusiast. I eagerly anticipate its release on DVD so that I can enjoy it in the comfort of my home, savoring every moment like a fine cordial...(*sigh*)..."
"Having ran across this film on the Fox movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can think of no better way to spend a lazy Friday evening then putting in my two cents worth. Especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it. Doesn't every movie, good or bad deserve more than four comments? And this movie isn't bad at all.<br /><br />The first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like April Love is to remember the era from which it came, in this case the late fifties. Films were pretty much a happy medium back then. The cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen Technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television. I don't know how many people were pried away from the boob tube to see this one, but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutes.<br /><br />Teen Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teen sent to live with his Aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car. It seems that his Aunt and Uncle have lost their own son (Jed Jr.)so Uncle Jed seems has lost his zest for living. Aunt Henrietta is hoping that Nick being on the farm will somehow bring Jed out of his doldrums. Story lines like this being what they are, Jed and Nick don't really care for each other too much of course. Jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels)and Liz (Shirley Jones)Templeton. Immediately Jed develops a crush on Fran, and of course I don't have to tell you that Liz develops a crush on Jed. Then there's the matter of Uncle Jed's horse, a trotter who has turned wild and won't let anyone handle him since the death of Jed Jr. You could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own, seeing as how there are no real surprises. Doesn't matter though, you'll enjoy yourself anyway.<br /><br />Once you get over the image of squeaky clean Pat Boone, as a supposedly bad boy, you'll have no trouble with the rest of the film. Considering that, Boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as Nick. Certainly the role doesn't require much depth, but still it's a nicely done job when you would least expect it. As Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for the role. In the early going, he is unreachable and cold, but as he slowly warms up to Nick, we see that he's really a pretty good guy. Jeannette Nolan is a lot of fun as Henrietta, who is constantly playing the part of mediator between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers And Hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents. As Liz, she's gorgeous to look at, great to listen to, and quite funny at times. Dolores Michaels as Fran, who is a bit more on the wild side, is equally entertaining.<br /><br />The best thing about April Love, is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen. Not one true villain in the whole thing. Everybody is so darn likable you can't help but enjoy the film. I truthfully find it quite refreshing, sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as the old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers, a little more plot, and wide screen Technicolor. The songs are a mixed bag, with the title song April Love being the best of them. Another thing I really liked is that they didn't fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences, and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it. As a matter of fact, you'll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they didn't skimp in that department. The chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. Best of all is how the dislike between Nick and Jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respect.<br /><br />This movie will never be confused with great cinema. Yet, sometimes instead of going to Disneyland, one just needs a nice outing in the park, and that's what April Love is.<br /><br />My Grade: B+<br /><br />",1,4131,True,12969,"Having stumbled upon this film on the Fox movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can't think of a better way to spend a Friday evening than sharing my thoughts. Every movie, good or bad, deserves more than four comments, and this one isn't bad at all.

Remember, April Love comes from the late fifties, an era when films were a happy medium, filled with wide screen Technicolor to lure people away from television.

Aunt Henrietta hopes Nick will bring Uncle Jed out of his doldrums after losing their own son. Nick meets the neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Fran captures Nick's interest, while Liz develops a crush on him. There's also Uncle Jed's horse, a trotter turned wild since the death of Jed Jr. While predictable, the film remains enjoyable.

Once you accept Pat Boone as a bad boy, the film becomes easy to enjoy. Boone delivers a surprisingly good performance as Nick. Arthur O'Connell is perfect as Uncle Jed, initially cold but gradually warming up to Nick. Jeannette Nolan is fun as Henrietta, the mediator. Shirley Jones, as Liz, is gorgeous, talented, and funny. Dolores Michaels, as the wilder Fran, is equally entertaining.

The best thing about April Love is the absence of a true villain. Everyone is likable, making the film refreshing, like a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as an old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers, more plot, and Technicolor. The title song, April Love, stands out. The horse racing sequences are exciting without relying on blue screen backdrops. The film is beautifully photographed, and the chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. The portrayal of the growing respect between Nick and Jed is well done.

April Love isn't great cinema, but sometimes a simple outing in the park is all you need.

"Take a subject I didn't know much about and make it exciting, why don't you? It so happens that back about 1979, director Robert Altman said that he didn't believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding skateboards--if he doesn't break his neck--will make the first movie. Well, I wouldn't put such an expectation on Stacy Peralta, but he is a skateboarder who has made a good movie. Of course, he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage, and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed. Peralta edited it together well with not-your-usual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today. The whole effect is post-modern in the best sense, but that has been done. Altman's prediction hasn't quite come true. What Peralta has done, however, is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the Z-Boys. This is all good. I highly recommend ""Dogtown.""",1,1061,True,44076,"Back in 1979, director Robert Altman speculated that the first real movie might be made by a young skateboarder. While Stacy Peralta may not fulfill that prophecy, he's crafted a compelling film.

Although Altman's prediction remains unrealized, Peralta's work shines with post-modern flair and energy. I highly recommend ""Dogtown."""

Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone actually attempt to actually watch this film. From the very beginning, you can tell that something is off, and as the film progresses, it only becomes more apparent. There are scenes that feel like they were cut and pasted from different movies, and the narrative structure, if you can even call it that, is all over the place. It's baffling how such a project could even get off the ground, let alone make it to the point of release. The lack of coherence is startling, and it almost feels as though the filmmakers were trying to fit several unrelated stories into one film. The dialogue ranges from wooden to nonsensical, leaving the actors with little to work with. Despite the efforts of Tom Wlaschiha, who does his best to navigate this chaotic landscape, the film fails to deliver any meaningful or engaging moments. The technical aspects do little to help, as the cinematography often feels uninspired and the direction lacks any clear vision or purpose. As a viewer, it becomes a struggle to stay engaged and invested in what is happening on screen. Each scene seems to stumble into the next without any logical progression, leaving the audience in a state of confusion and disbelief. It's a shame because there could have been potential in the initial concept, but it seems to have been lost in the execution. The title, Not One Sleeps, seems ironic given that staying awake through the entire experience is a challenge in itself. The film's shortcomings are so glaring that it's hard to imagine how it passed through the various stages of production without someone stepping in to address the issues. In the end, it serves as a reminder of how crucial a cohesive script and competent direction are to the success of a film. Despite some promising elements, the film ultimately falls flat, leaving viewers to wonder what could have been if more care and attention had been given to its development."

Yet after this film there were no good Ernest films!,1,93,False,42501,"This is a good film, offering plenty of entertainment and showcasing a well-crafted storyline. The humor throughout the movie is genuinely funny, with moments that will keep audiences laughing from start to finish. The comedic timing and delivery are spot-on, making it a standout in its genre. Yet, despite the success and enjoyment this film provides, it is unfortunate that after this film, there were no good Ernest films to follow. The charm and wit that made this movie so enjoyable seemed to be lost in subsequent productions. It's a shame because the potential for more quality films was certainly there, but sadly, it was never realized in the films that came after."
"This is the most difficult movie I have ever seen...the emotional content is horrific, yet unforgetable. A woman who is accused of being a political activist is brought in for questioning. The whole movie revolves around her interrogation. Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve Oscars for their performances.",1,357,False,38920,"This is the most difficult movie I have ever seen, and I say that with the utmost conviction. The emotional content is nothing short of horrific, yet it remains utterly unforgettable in its impact. The story centers around a woman who finds herself accused of being a political activist, which leads to a tense and gripping scenario as she is brought in for questioning. The entire movie revolves around the intense and unyielding process of her interrogation, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere that keeps the audience on edge from start to finish.

The performances delivered by Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe are nothing short of extraordinary. Both actors bring such depth and intensity to their roles that they truly deserve Oscars for their captivating and powerful performances. Their portrayals are so compelling and nuanced that they elevate the film to a whole new level of cinematic excellence.

As the narrative unfolds, the viewer is drawn deeper into the psychological and emotional turmoil experienced by the characters, making it an even more challenging watch. The film does not shy away from exploring the darker aspects of human nature and the complexities of political dynamics, which adds layers of complexity to the storyline. The combination of a gripping plot, masterful acting, and profound emotional content makes this film a truly unforgettable experience, despite its difficult subject matter."

It's astonishing that a movie with such a premise could be executed so poorly, leaving viewers wondering how it ever got made in the first place. The direction is lackluster, with scenes dragging on longer than necessary, further testing the patience of anyone brave enough to sit through the whole thing. The film fails to deliver on any front, lacking suspense, intrigue, or any semblance of entertainment value. It's a testament to how bad movies can get when all elements fall completely flat."

"I first heard of Unisol 2 when I drove past a cinema when I was on holiday in America. I really did not take much notice of it until I bought the original on DVD which led me to find out about its three sequels. I subsequently started to read about The Return on the IMDB and asked friends what they thought of it. Despite their horrific criticisms of it, I still went out of my way to see it and was on the brink of buying it until I saw it for hire on DVD. I wasn't expecting much but thought that it must have been half decent to get a theatrical release in the US, after all, how often is it that you see Van Damme on the big screen? Well, nothing could have prepared me for this. It is so bad I almost cried. What a total waste of 80 minutes and £2.50. It is hard to explain how bad this move is. Honestly. This is idiotic film making. No, it's more than idiotic. I just cannot believe how this got made. I cannot believe that someone out there has not murdered Mic Rogers. How stupid can people possibly be - firstly, Van Damme actually thinking the script and finished film was good. Secondly, the fact that Xander Berkley, of Terminator 2 and Air Force One status, commited himself to this film. I simply cannot believe the stupidity of this movie. It takes itself so seriously but comes across to the audience like a spoof. Here is an example: JCVD's daughter (yes, Luc is now a human again)- ""I want my Daddy"", SETH- ""So do I"". Oh yeah, and some guy tries to shut down SETH by pulling three huge levers with - wait for it - ON and OFF written on them. The acting all round is like playschool acting. I'm sure Mr Director modelled Luc's reporter girlfriend on April O'Neil from the cartoon Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles - she refuses to go because she '...needs her story'. I mean come on - how many cliches can a film possibly use? Please listen to me fellow IMDB users - don't touch this with a barge pole. To conclude, Universal Soldier: The Return has no relation whatsoever to the first movie. In fact, if they weren't called UniSols then you would never know it was a sequel. Luc is now a human again - what the hell!?! The only place in which he can access the internet is in a stripclub. All the new Uni Sols look like they were dragged off the street, they are that unconvincing. This is pure torture to watch, so do yourself a favour - don't torture yourself.

"There's more to offer in the opening of The Odd Couple than in the entirety of most films. Felix Unger (the poor guy's monogram even curses him) checks into a New York hotel. A cleaning lady says ""Good night."" ""Goodbye,"" he answers back. In his room he empties his pockets, then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope, addressed to his wife and beloved children. When the viewer finally puts it together  aha, he's going to off himself  we watch him struggle to open the window  oh no, he's going to jump  The poor guy injures his lower back. This is all you need to know about Felix Unger  his wife has left him, he's a compulsive cleaner and he's a hypochondriac. And all in one scene. This is the particular genius of Neil Simon's comedy  it's about situation and character. There are few obvious physical jokes  no kicks to the groin, no cheap gags  just funny characters in uncomfortable situations. And, of course, he is a master of manipulating the audience's expectations. Coming from the Swingers era, imagine what I thought in the date scene when Felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate Oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment. He's blowing it, right? Think again. The girls love his sensitivity, his ability to cry in front of them. They invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because Oscar wasn't paying enough attention to it. He's in like Flynn, right? Uh, yes, but he doesn't want to go with the girls because he's feeling vulnerable. Great stuff. And it's made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight-room apartment set. You've got Jack Lemmon and the slouchy, pouchy Walter Matthau for Chrissakes, why mess it up? The visual style reminded me of Breakfast at Tiffany's, in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action. Particularly memorable is the scene in which Felix, fleeing from Oscar, closes a partition only to realize the partition doesn't cover the side where Oscar is coming from. You get a real sense of the layout of the apartment, and thus the proximity in which the two divorcées live. The twist here is that these two are really married  to each other. So the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys.",1,2472,True,24114,"There's more to offer in the opening of The Odd Couple than in most films.

His portrayal is nuanced and layered, capturing the complexity of Scrooge's transformation from a greedy, bitter miser to a compassionate and generous man.

His interactions with the ghosts are particularly compelling, revealing the depth of his internal struggle and eventual enlightenment. The superb job done by the supporting actors adds greatly to this production, enriching the narrative with their performances and breathing life into their characters. The ensemble cast works harmoniously to create a cohesive and engaging experience for the audience. 

In addition to the strong performances, the direction and pacing of the film are expertly handled, ensuring that the story unfolds smoothly and maintains the viewer's interest throughout.

This approach to storytelling has a long history in cinema, where animals are often given human-like traits to engage audiences and create a bond between the characters and viewers. The film effectively captures this essence, making it a delightful experience for families and children alike. 

Based on a true story, Buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other, and that they will do anything for each other. The film delves into the deep emotional connections that can form between humans and animals, highlighting the compassion and dedication that the characters demonstrate. This aspect of the story resonates with viewers, as it emphasizes the universal themes of love and loyalty, which are central to the human experience.

While not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children. The filmmakers have done an impressive job with the animation, bringing the gorilla to life in a way that is both believable and endearing. This attention to detail enhances the film's appeal, particularly for younger audiences who are captivated by the antics and adventures that unfold within the household. The humor and chaos that ensue provide plenty of entertainment and laughter, making it a memorable viewing experience.

This film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets, but does show the difficulties. While the narrative focuses on the lighthearted and amusing aspects of living with a gorilla, it subtly acknowledges the challenges and potential consequences of such a decision. This aspect of the story serves as a cautionary tale, albeit understated, reminding viewers of the complexities and responsibilities involved in caring for wild animals. 

A recommended film which was the first for Jim Henson Productions. As the inaugural film for this renowned production company, Buddy holds a special place in cinematic history. It showcases the creativity and innovation that Jim Henson Productions is known for, setting the stage for future projects that continue to capture the imagination of audiences around the world. Overall, Buddy is a charming and enjoyable film that offers both entertainment and a glimpse into the unique bond between humans and animals."

The whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of Rodger Corman's studio when he'd give a first-time director a few bucks and a camera--but without the discipline Corman would impose. The absence of such discipline means that what might have been charmingly rough around the edges instead feels like a mishmash of poorly executed ideas. The film's pacing is erratic, with moments dragging on endlessly while others rush by without leaving any impact. Characters are introduced and discarded with little regard for coherence, and the humor, which should be the film's saving grace, falls flat at nearly every turn. It's a movie that sets out to entertain but ultimately only manages to highlight its own inadequacies, leaving viewers to wonder what might have been with a more focused vision and a bit more polish."

There's a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl, instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha. I'm afraid I don't have the patience to write more."
"The pace of the film is ponderously slow in parts, but if you can tune into its languid speed and lengthy silences then it is a satisfying piece of courtly intrigue. The story of the first Emperor of China, his childhood sweetheart and the personal cost of power. The film is very atmospheric, the extremely mannered and polite courtly ceremony and ritual contrasted with sudden brutal violence. Filmed in a way that evokes shadows and cold spaces. Battle scenes are rare and short, the focus is on the battle within the individual on what is right to do and whether the ends justify the means. The emperor's journey from idealistic peacemaker to ruthless tyrant is aiming to be subtle, but gives little background or convincing insight into the motivation of the Emperor, indeed his actions and aims do not really change throughout, only Gong Li's attitudes to him are altered. The most interesting performances are Gong Li's and the titular Assassin as they reassess when to fight, when to retreat, when to kill. The most expensive film ever made in China at the time, the Emperor and the Assassin does not rely on hysteric emotion or big battles, but rather a brooding atmosphere of menace and inevitability.

The plot unfolds predictably, with no real twists or turns to keep the audience invested. It's a film that lacks any sense of urgency or excitement, failing to capture the viewer's attention in any meaningful way. The characters are one-dimensional, and their development is stunted, leaving them unrelatable and forgettable. The dialogue is uninspired, lacking wit or depth that could have added some much-needed interest. The score fails to enhance the experience, blending into the background and adding nothing to the atmosphere. Even the editing feels lackluster, with scenes that linger too long or cut away too quickly, disrupting the overall flow. (Apart from James Mason, who is always great, but in this one underused.) His talent is evident, but the script doesn’t allow him to shine as he should. I suppose it is hard to write anything about this film because it didn't evoke any reaction in me whatsoever.

"I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.

It was around that time that I had the pleasure of watching the BBC adaptation, which featured the talented actors Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke in the lead roles. The adaptation was truly an excellent version and stayed very true to the essence of the book. It captured the spirit and depth of the story beautifully. However, years later, I happened to lay eyes on another adaptation of 'Jane Eyre,' and I was utterly horrified by what I saw. In this version, William Hurt was cast as Mr. Rochester, and I found him to be totally miscast in this pivotal role. Mr. Rochester is meant to be a passionate and intense character, full of depth and complexity, whereas William Hurt portrayed him as a block of ice, lacking the fiery passion that the character demands. The same disappointment goes for Charlotte Gainsborough, who played the role of Jane Eyre. Her portrayal was equally lacking in energy and emotion. It was as if I was watching two zombies together on screen. This is meant to be a story about love and passion, a tale that explores deep emotions and intense connections, but unfortunately, I couldn't see any of it in this particular version. No, for a truly immersive and emotionally engaging experience, I will always return to the BBC version.

"Any film about WWII made during WWII by a British production company has no latter-day peer in my opinion, respectfully. The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War Two and particularly naval warfare, I favor depictions of subs and action in the North Atlantic and especially those which include the German side of things. For those unacquainted with target priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here. The pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studios back in the day: frankly I prefer its quieter, more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced Hollywood movie ever could. This reminds me of Powell and Pressburger's The 49th Parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive Eric Portman, a favorite of mine. John Mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles, so this is clearly meant to be Mr. Portman's film but the whole cast shines.

"A fun concept, but poorly executed. Except for the fairly good makeup effects, there's really not much to it. There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days... and once he's deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time.<br /><br />In any case, the movie has far worse problems than that--the cinematography is decidedly low-budget-TV-show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around. Robert John Burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling Charlton Heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse.<br /><br />The only reason why I'm giving this movie as high as I am is that once the movie enters its last 1/3 or so and Joe Mantegna's character takes over, the movie develops a fun, campy 'cheesefest slaughterhouse' feel, and the gangster's crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch.

Although it is well acted and directed, the underlying story simply plods along too slowly. The pacing of the narrative seemed to drag, making it difficult to stay engaged throughout the entire runtime. The performances by the cast were commendable, bringing depth and nuance to their characters, and the direction was skillful, ensuring that each scene was visually appealing and well-executed. However, despite these strengths, the story failed to maintain a consistent momentum that would keep viewers on the edge of their seats.

Granted, in another mood I would have liked it better. Sometimes, the enjoyment of a film can heavily depend on the viewer's current state of mind and expectations. On a different day, perhaps I would have appreciated the film's subtleties and slower pace more. I did chuckle a lot, but rarely laughed out loud; and there was actually a sense of suspense to discover who won. The humor, while present, was more understated than I anticipated, eliciting more smiles and quiet chuckles rather than hearty laughter. Nevertheless, there was a genuine sense of intrigue as the story unfolded, especially in trying to unravel the mystery of who ultimately came out on top.

But in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day (one neither of us had heard of before) this one paled in comparison. The other film, despite being unfamiliar to us, managed to capture our attention and deliver a more engaging and memorable experience. This contrast highlighted the shortcomings of the film in question, emphasizing how it failed to leave a lasting impression despite its technical merits and talented cast.

If you see lots of movies, then by all means see this -- it's distinctly better than your average fare. For avid moviegoers who consume films regularly, this one might offer enough merit to warrant a viewing. It stands above the standard offerings available and has certain qualities that could be appreciated by those who watch a wide array of films. But if you (like me) have limited time and want to watch only the best and most entertaining, save this for later. For those with a more selective approach to movie-watching, prioritizing only the most captivating and exceptional films, it might be best to reserve this one for a time when your options are more limited or when you are in the mood for something slightly off the beaten path.

A group of Iranian girls and lovers of soccer, driven by their passion for the sport, decided to dress like boys and made an attempt to enter the stadium. However, their attempt was unsuccessful, and they were arrested. This incident highlights the lengths to which these young women were willing to go to support their national team and be part of the electrifying atmosphere of the match. 

Soccer (and Flamengo's team), beach, and movies are my greatest passions; therefore I was absolutely captivated and loved this little gem about a group of girls and their unwavering passion for soccer. The director Jafar Panahi, renowned for his work in ""The White Balloon,"" ""The Mirror,"" and ""The Circle,"" skillfully shot this movie on the very day that Iran defeated Bahrain and secured their qualification for the World Cup in Germany. This context adds a layer of authenticity and excitement to the film, as it captures the real emotions and stakes involved in that historic match. 

The dramatic and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most delightful movies I have ever seen, as it combines a poignant social commentary with humor and heart. The film effectively portrays the struggles and determination of these young women, showcasing their courage and love for the game, despite the societal constraints they face. My vote is nine, as it truly stands out as an exceptional and inspiring story.

The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre, perfectly capturing the cheesy essence of 80s horror films. It has that unmistakable, tinny sound that seems to be an obligatory feature of low-budget horror flicks from that era. There's also a few very amusing scenes that stuck with me over the years.

It's one of those moments that made me laugh at the time, probably more than it should have, but that's part of the charm of these movies.

"The 2005 edition of the Royal Rumble came live from the Save Mart Centre in Fresno, California. The two top Championships of the WWE were being defended, The Undertaker was battling Heidenreich in a Casket match, Shawn Michaels was taking on Edge in a grudge match that had been building up since last October and of course the every man for himself over the top rope Royal Rumble match itself. Who was going to take the price this year? Chris Benoit? Edge? Eddie Guerrero? Edge? John Cena? Batista? Edge? Shawn Michaels? There was no shortage of contenders.<br /><br />It was Batista that picked up the popular victory in the main event battle but not without controversy, or should I say, a botched finish. Batista and John Cena were the final two men in the ring. Batista was supposed to dump the young Smackdown! star over the top rope but it all went wrong and they both went toppling to the floor. The referees acted on their feet as we had an arm-raising contest similar to that of Bret hart and Lex Luger back in 1994. This brought out the chairman of the board. Vinnie Mac walked down to the ring the way only he can but injured himself badly getting into the ring. It was unusual to see Vince McMahon sitting, legs out, telling the two men to restart the match. Batista then did was he was supposed to do first time round and dumped Cena to the floor sealing his own future with a Championship match at WrestleMania 21.<br /><br />The undercard for this years Royal Rumble had a very solid line up, with many of WWE's biggest stars competing in matches. Each brand had two big matches each.<br /><br />Raw opened the night with the match between Shawn Michaels and Edge. This was a good technical contest. Back and fourth all the way until Edge got the pinfall. This was a smart booking decision and kept Edge as a contender to the World Heavyweight Championship.<br /><br />The second match of the night was the feud ending Casket match between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The match was not a classic, but then again have their been any classic Casket matches? It was entertaining. Especially when Snitsky got involved and then Kane popped out the casket to a great pop. The Undertaker surprised no one when he got the win, slamming the lid on Heidenreich and this mediocre feud.<br /><br />The first of the two Championship matches of the night was John Bradshaw Layfields defence of the WWE Championship in a triple Threat match against both Kurt Angle and the Big Show. This match was very good. Again, not a classic but entertaining none the less. JBL took the win after pinning Kurt Angle. His celebration was short lived however when backstage teddy Long informed him at No Way Out he would defend the WWE Championship in a Barbed Wire Steel cage match against Big Show. Not a very nice way to spend a Sunday night.<br /><br />And of course there is no show without Punch. Punch of course being reigning World Heavyweight Champion Triple H. His rematch from Unforgiven 2004 with Randy Orton was lot better than the original encounter. It's a pity because they just don't seem to click to well in the ring and this would be an excellent feud if they did. Orton played the concussion role very well and went down in defeat to The Game.<br /><br />So the first big one of 2005 was a good one. It achieved its goals. Feuds ended and new ones began.

Not many films manage to engage the feeling of the book as well as Mother Night does, making it a rare accomplishment in the world of adaptations. It’s impressive how the filmmakers were able to translate the intricate layers of the narrative into a visual medium without losing the core essence of the story. The performances by the entire cast enhance the movie, but it is Nolte's portrayal that truly stands out, bringing to life the nuances and emotional depth that are so integral to the book. The film manages to convey the same sense of introspection and moral ambiguity that the book so powerfully explores. Despite the challenges of adapting such a complex narrative, Mother Night succeeds in delivering a cinematic experience that resonates with both fans of the book and those new to the story. This makes it not just a great adaptation, but a remarkable film in its own right."

This movie has errors, but it isn't a classic like Werewolf. It is entertaining if you like really low-budget, error-prone movies. You better see Demonicus!"
"Shame to see an interesting story diluted into standard ""Vietnam made for TV"" fare. Usually HBO movies are a substantial cut above TV.

Typically, HBO movies are known for being a substantial cut above regular TV offerings, providing viewers with rich storytelling and high production values. However, this particular film falls short of those expectations. Bill Paxton, who was a pretty good choice for the lead role, unfortunately wasn't given much to work with. His talents seem underutilized in a film that could have been so much more. The potential for a compelling narrative was there, but somehow the execution missed the mark, leaving viewers with a sense of what could have been rather than what is. It's disappointing to see a network known for its quality productions deliver something that feels so ordinary and formulaic. The promise of an engaging and unique perspective on a Vietnam story was overshadowed by the reliance on tropes and clichés that have been seen time and time again."
"I accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels. I immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast, ""groovy"" haircuts aside, and wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of both past and future stars? Having not seen the original, I guessed it might be the Poseidon Adventure, since it was obviously on a ship in distress. Was I wrong! I cannot for the life of me imagine why any of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such trash. There is no story, the performances all looked forced, the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event, and start pontificating about the real meaning of life at the level of bumper sticker philosophy.<br /><br />It is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such greats as Sally Field, Michael Caine, et al. They must have needed the money badly. Can we blame the director?",0,964,False,28748,"I accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels.

There is no story, the performances all looked forced, the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event, and start pontificating about the real meaning of life at the level of bumper sticker philosophy.

As I sat there watching, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disbelief. This was a film that seemed to have everything going for it, at least on paper. The cast was filled with actors who had either made their mark in the industry or were on the cusp of doing so. These were individuals whose work I had admired in other projects, yet here they were, struggling through a script that seemed to do them no favors. The dialogue was clunky, filled with clichés and platitudes that might have been at home on a motivational poster but felt completely out of place in a film that was ostensibly about survival and human resilience.

The ship setting, which could have provided a claustrophobic and intense backdrop for the drama, was instead underutilized. The tension that should have been palpable was instead missing, leaving a void that was filled with performances that, to put it bluntly, seemed phoned in. It's as if the actors themselves knew they were fighting a losing battle against a script that gave them nothing to work with. Instead of characters with depth, we were given caricatures, each one a shallow representation of what could have been much more nuanced and compelling roles.

The film's attempts at exploring deeper themes were laughable at best. Characters would launch into monologues about the meaning of life that were so trite and simplistic they bordered on parody. It was as though the film was trying to say something profound, but couldn't quite figure out what that was, resulting in a muddled mess of ideas that never coalesced into anything meaningful. This was not the introspective exploration of humanity that it perhaps aspired to be, but rather a collection of half-baked thoughts presented with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.

It is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such greats as Sally Field, Michael Caine, et al. They must have needed the money badly. Can we blame the director? It seems that everyone involved, from the cast to the crew, was let down by a project that promised much but delivered little. The director, who should have been the guiding force, appears to have been unable to steer this ship away from the iceberg it ultimately collided with. For fans of the actors, perhaps there's a certain morbid curiosity in watching them flounder through this cinematic disaster, but for anyone else, this is likely a film best left adrift at sea."
"Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his bossy fiancé, Kate (Eva Longoria) are looking over the last minute arrangements for their reception. It is the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy, giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation. But, horror of horrors, the ""angel"" ice sculpture, ordered by Kate, arrives without wings. In an ensuing fight with the sculptor, the heavy ""ice"" maiden falls on Kate and sends her to the hereafter. Now, one year later, Henry's sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward. Yet, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) becomes interested in Henry herself, much to the chagrin of her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create havoc for Ashley, as she has no intentions of letting another woman get her hands on Henry. Can anything be done to return Kate into heaven for good? This is an abysmal romantic comedy, one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen. No, its not the cast, as they try gamely to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fiancé and Bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious. Biggs, a funny thespian, too, is totally wasted. As for Rudd, a very gifted performer (see Anchorman, Knocked Up, or Clueless, please) he tries hardest of all and, in truth, is the main reason to see this clunker. His charm, looks, and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable. But, nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you fork over any money for this one. Even were free tickets to fall into your lap, be warned that this movie is a near-death experience for those who adore love-and-laugh cinema.",0,1913,True,3104,"Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his bossy fiancé, Kate (Eva Longoria), are finalizing their wedding reception plans.

ACTING Not that bad not that great either apart from Daphne Zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine, and the rest well quite dull although Laura Lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end.

THE KILLS Can't really see why they banned this, the kills look fake mostly, one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake, but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car, one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive.

"I caught the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows he can act past Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as the overbearing mother. Julie Walters is hilarious as Dame Evie Walton, with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope that this film is picked up by an American distributor so that everyone can see it. This film is not only about Driving Lessons, but life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life.

Rupert Grint truly shows that he can act beyond his iconic role as Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter series. It's refreshing to see him take on a character like Ben, and he does so with remarkable skill and depth. Laura Linney is absolutely amazing in her role as the overbearing mother, bringing both intensity and nuance to the character. Her performance truly adds another layer to the film, making it even more compelling to watch.

Julie Walters is downright hilarious as Dame Evie Walton. Her character is unforgettable, with a mouth that's worse than a sailor's, delivering lines that are sure to make audiences laugh out loud. Walters' comedic timing and ability to embody such a vibrant, unapologetic character is simply fantastic. I really hope that this film is picked up by an American distributor soon so that everyone has the opportunity to see it. It's a film that deserves to be widely viewed and appreciated by audiences everywhere.

This film is not just about Driving Lessons, but it delves into life lessons as well. Ben, portrayed by Rupert Grint, is a young man who finds himself torn between his desire to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father, and his longing to live his own life and make his own choices. This internal conflict is portrayed beautifully, and it's something that many people can relate to on a personal level. The film's exploration of these themes is both poignant and thought-provoking.

It's an amazing film from an amazing director, who has taken his own life experiences and put them on the screen for everyone to see. The authenticity and heart behind the storytelling are evident, making it a truly meaningful cinematic experience. Everyone who has the chance to see it should take advantage of that opportunity, as it offers a unique perspective and a deeply engaging narrative."

"I admire 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its frankness  pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the lead/director Joe Swanberg. They weren't afraid to show trueness to everyday ""private"" occurrences. Unfortunately, the film falls under the 'The Brown Bunny' realm, though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, it mirrors 'Bunny' with a whole lot of nothing going on, or too many cinematography shots focused (or sincerely unfocused) on absolutely nothing  feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I can see why this film was released, and why people are renting: true life sex scenes and full frontal (equally, both male and female) nudity. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time. We quickly learn of a post-college male/female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex-boyfriend. Other than that, we are subjected to the every-day events of their boring lives: she works for her parents; he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. For this all to work, the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real. Neither work and it's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour, i.e. 'The Brown Bunny.' The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich, and even she does some questionable acting. (The DVD extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching/listening to.) Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower-habits, but overall the film falls flat.

"My first review of 2010 is ""Into The Blue 2: The Reef"".

One day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about Columbus' hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reef.<br /><br />Next day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing. A few more days past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they can't escape otherwise they will be killed. They were hired to find two big containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core.<br /><br />The movie also has a back story about another person (brother of the lead character) trying to patch things up with his girlfriend, I reckon this part of the story was a waste of time, this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasn't needed to be shown.<br /><br />However apart from that, this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives 4 stars.

Watching it felt like an experience that I had been preparing for, and it was satisfying to finally see the story unfold on screen.

I can't say the movie was great. It didn't reach the heights of some other films I've seen, and it didn't leave me in awe. And I can't say that the movie was hilarious. There were moments that made me chuckle, but it wasn't a laugh-out-loud kind of comedy. But it was good and it has some pretty funny points. There are scenes that catch you by surprise with their humor, and those moments add a nice touch to the overall experience. That aside, the shots in this movie are just beautiful. The cinematography is something to admire, with scenes that are visually stunning and capture the essence of the story. And the entire cast, especially Brenda Blethyn (someone I hadn't seen before, sadly), were excellent.

I recommend checking it out, unless you've just had a death in the family. In such a case, the uplifting nature of the film might not align with your current emotions. However, if you're in the mood for something light-hearted, it's worth a watch. 

If anything, the final chapter is highly worth the money. The conclusion ties everything together in a way that is satisfying and memorable. It's the kind of ending that leaves you with a smile, making the entire journey feel worthwhile. >.<"

"In Carmen, Saura once again seeks to establish a dynamic rapport between reality and fiction, between the actual passions of the personalities in a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance portions of the opera Carmen and the scripted passions from the story of the fictional Carmen, the famous fatal mix of a free spirit (read disregard for fidelity) and her ability to drive men mad with desire. Saura used this same vehicle fiction/reality in an earlier black-and-white film, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But, whereas the tensions between the dancers rehearsing Blood Wedding showed to advantage how they evolved into the fictional characters of the story to be performed through directing their emotions into their roles, in Carmen, the parallel between the petty, libidinal urges of the dancers of the troop during rehearsals and the spirit forging to do with the mythic Carmen never comes even close to being believable. It remains a gadget, and, for that reason, a bothersome distraction. One really needs to see Blood Wedding next to Carmen to appreciate the comparison. However, it hardly matters, the melodrama Saura tries to impose upon his Carmen, because the Flamenco dancing and guitar music of the rehearsals_ which are 95% of the film _by some of the best known Flamenco dancers and musicians, more than repays the price of entry.

Both lead girls take their shirts off briefly. The special effects are mind-boggling (I particularly liked the incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences). Everyone has a silly Canadian accent, adding to the hilarity. Well worth the price of rental. We laughed until we cried."

"On October of 1945, the American German descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in a post-war Frankfurt and his bitter Uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) gets a job for him in the Zentropa train line as a sleeping car conductor. While traveling in the train learning his profession, he sees the destructed occupied Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the former powerful entrepreneur of transport business and owner of Zentropa, Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold stays neutral between the allied forces and the Germans, and becomes aware that there is a terrorist group called ""Werewolves"" killing the sympathizers of the allied and conducting subversive actions against the allied forces. He falls in love for Katharina, and sooner she discloses that she was a ""Werewolf"". When Max commits suicide, Leopold is also pressed by the ""Werewolves"" and need to take a position and a decision.<br /><br />""Europa"" is an impressive and anguishing Kafkanian story of the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using an expressionist style that recalls Fritz Lang and alternating a magnificent black & white cinematography with some colored details, this movie discloses a difficult period of Germany and some of the problems this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war. Very impressive the action of the occupation forces destroying resources that could permit a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country, and the corruption with the Jew that should identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody. The hypnotic narration of Max Von Sydow is another touch of class in this awarded film.

"Sometimes I rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and/or crocodiles are still getting made these days. They've been making these lame ""Jaws""-copies since the 70s, it's not like they're getting any more well-liked. The idea is still exactly the same. So we have an animal that starts murdering people. First it takes down some secondary characters, then it starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow, usually with an explosion. Then, we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc. etc. ""Krocodylus"" basically uses the same overused ideas, and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation.

You'll see ninety minutes of changing locations, most of them will be blown up later on in the movie. It's as if the filmmakers were playing a game of cinematic hopscotch, leaping from one scene to the next with reckless abandon. Right in the beginning, you see a nice little farm typical for the Berry, which is in the movie moved close to Paris. It's a quaint, idyllic setting that hints at a simpler life, but then, in a bizarre twist of fate, it does not survive the ""transport"" to the Isle de France very well: it explodes 1 minute later. The explosion is so sudden and inexplicable that it leaves you questioning the very laws of movie physics. There are also two gangsters who have no tongues, as if that would make sense in the world of SMS and internet, let alone pencil and paper. Their presence is baffling, adding another layer of absurdity to an already nonsensical plot.

It just goes on like that, nothing makes sense in this story. The narrative spirals further into chaos with each passing scene, leaving coherence by the wayside. Characters appear and disappear without reason, their motives as opaque as the plot itself. My only credit goes to the cameraman, the camera is excellent. Amidst the narrative disarray, the cinematography stands out as a lone beacon of competence. The camera work is crisp and visually engaging, capturing the chaos with an artistry that belies the disjointed storytelling."

"The Best Years of Our Life is often compared to It's a Wonderful Life. They never should be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. It is hard to know what value individual life may have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What a statistic we have to live with.) Also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years. We have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just, especially the ones that have been fought recently.<br /><br />I have been a life long pacifist. I oppose all war. Not long ago I had that position tested. It occurred while I was on the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which I live. It is a powerful experience, moving around on her decks. She had seen a great deal of action. Someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought.<br /><br />I cannot watch The Best Years of Our Life without thinking about things like the Lexington.<br /><br />Each of the three veterans paid their dues. And they paid mine as well.<br /><br />No one of them got off any easier than any other. The Navy, Air Force and Army paid equally although in different ways. Each had problems directly related to the war. And each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war, because each had to do it on his own. Each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.<br /><br />The moving part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. It is hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens.<br /><br />The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife  standard fair for 30's/40's films. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. That's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.<br /><br />Al is not free of advice he does not totally want. Any time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.<br /><br />All of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency which he does, making him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves.<br /><br />I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about.

His performances can, at times, be downright painful to watch, although I must admit that my wife seems to think he's quite cute, which is a point of contention between us. Dan Aykroyd, who is usually a fantastic actor and often brings a lot to his roles, was even a bit disappointing in his portrayal of the crooked cop in this film.

"I guess the previous ""House"" movie was a hit, prompting Universal to wring a few more drops from the monster cash-cow. The creative team must've been in a recycling mood, starting with the opening theme lifted from 'Son of Frankenstein' and some of the stock footage dispersed through the film, like one unintentionally funny bit of business where footage of Glenn Strange as the monster is mixed with clips of Karloff from 1935's Bride, and compared to how robotic Strange moved, Karloff seems to move like a cheetah in comparison.<br /><br />Previous film continuity is thrown by the wayside, concerning the miraculous death-cheating abilities of the Wolf Man and Dracula, but when Dr. Edelmann & Larry Talbot discover Frankenstein's monster with the skeleton representing Boris Karloff , Edward T.

Drac is told he suffers from a blood disease, a very rare sickness that allows him to transform into a bat or evaporate if sunlight touches him. >:-] And Larry Talbot just has a little pressure on the brain. Of course all of this is painstakingly explained with a 'lot' of medical jargon being related in many scenes throughout. This proves to be the biggest hindrance, as somewhere along the way the filmmakers seem to forget about actual horror or entertainment in favor of giving the monsters conditions that seem as treatable as a flu. <br /><br />As a huge fan of the old Universal horrors, it's rare that I feel so bored while watching one.

"This extremely bargain-basement Blaxploitation/Kung-Fu hybrid was in my country released by a questionable DVD label that usually speaking just occupies with the transfer of pure crap onto disc, so that wasn't exactly a favorable herald. Several other titles were released in the same series, like ""The Black Six"", ""The Black Gestapo"" and ""The Black Godfather"" and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews none of these belong to the elite of the 70's Blaxploitation hype, neither. ""TNT Jackson"" is a pretty lousy film, completely lacking a significant plot but featuring far too many laughable fighting scenes and horrible acting to compensate. Apparently Roger Corman  never too embarrassed to make some easy money  assigned two of his most loyal acolytes to rapidly invent a simplistic story that would appeal to fans of both oriental Kung-Fu movies and contemporary trendy Blaxploitation flicks. The result Cirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller came up with was ""TNT Jackson""; the tale of an arse-whooping black babe traveling to Hong Kong in search of her missing brother. She quickly discovers he was killed by a criminal network of drug-smugglers and swears to avenge him. Mrs. Jackson smoothly infiltrates into the underground and encounters macho pimps, helpful undercover agents, loads of vicious Kung-Fu fighters. Only one thing's for sure; they all want a piece of TNT's ravishing body in one way or another. I sincerely doubt movie concepts get any more elementary than this, but  unfortunately - all the other aspects suck too. The battle scenes are overlong and moreover pathetically staged. Jeannie Bell and the other poor suckers try really hard to stare menacingly and assume a tough position, but eventually all they ever do is kick in the air and stupidly leap across rooms. The cinematography is horrid, the soundtrack is vastly disappointing (whatever happened to soul music?), the few dialogs are poorly written and the acting performances are inferior. Speaking of which, Jeannie Bell is undeniably a beautiful woman, but still she can't hold a candle to Tamara Dobson or Pam Grier. There's only one really good and memorable scene in ""TNT Jackson"", namely the famous hotel room battle where Bell, entirely naked except for panties, repeatedly switches the light on and off whilst kicking the hell out of some goons. Amusing scene ... I just haven't figured out yet whether it's thanks to the light switch ingenuity or Bell's perfectly shaped breasts.",0,2487,True,27373,"This bargain-basement Blaxploitation/Kung-Fu hybrid was released in my country by a questionable DVD label known for transferring low-quality films onto disc.

They had to be that talented to play in such a demented and chaotic manner. I really like it and wholeheartedly recommend it for movie lovers of all ages, as it offers something for everyone to enjoy.

The movie is set in a turn-of-the-century firehouse, featuring a crew of misfits who double as both firemen and the department band when they’re not busy fighting fires. The film is filled with the usual running gags you would expect, plus the additional mayhem brought by Spike Jones and his Orchestra, who never fail to entertain with their unique style and comedic flair. In addition to the musical antics, there is also comedy relief provided by the talented comedian Buddy Hackett, whose timing and humor add another layer of enjoyment to the film. Alongside him, the straight-man Hugh O'Brien delivers a performance that perfectly complements the chaotic energy of the movie.

Overall, this film is a delightful experience that combines music, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia, making it a timeless classic that appeals to audiences young and old. It's a movie I am eager to share with future generations, ensuring that the humor and talent of Spike Jones and his crew continue to be appreciated and celebrated for years to come."

"Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously so. Built on the framework of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to plunge into the action right away. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of The Dirty Dozen's major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters.<br /><br />Bu ditching the training sequences, Tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also giving us glimpses into the world of French and German civilians, both collaborators and Resistance.<br /><br />It goes without saying that any Tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino made the decision to have the French characters speak French and the Germans speak German, beyond adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in French was as sharp and funny and clever as his English dialogue.<br /><br />Case in point, during the opening sequence the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) is interrogating French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a family of Jews. While subtly pressuring LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After greedily gulping it down, Landa compliments LaPadite on his daughters and his cows, ""à votre famille et à vos vaches, je dis bravo."" The thing of it is, in French ""vache"" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If reprimanded for this vulgar pun, Landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand French well enough to have meant it that way, but Landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat. And LaPadite understands his meaning all too well.<br /><br />That is a really subtle piece of acting and word-play that many audiences would never catch, or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich with that kind of detail. All of the French and English dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while I can't swear to the German, I would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft.<br /><br />Inglorious Basterds opens with the phrase, ""Once Upon a Time... in Nazi-Occupied France."" Personally, this reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and movie, another comic fantasy in a war-torn occupied France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is howlingly funny in places, although the film also turns darkly serious.<br /><br />In its more serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax, as in almost every elongated sequence of the film, Tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels.<br /><br />Tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous, even inflammable and that its power deserves respect.<br /><br />If you can see this film as I did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke, that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen.

"This two and a half hour long film was shown recently at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) at a 10 PM show. There was a scheduled 1 AM show after that, but wondered if anyone was going to stay awake to see that until 3:30 am. The opening scene is of a man walking in a field, and it lasts four minutes of movie time. It is an ominous sign of what's to come: a good 144 minutes more of pretty much the same. There is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. It is repeated 15 times, with very sparse dialogue. Occasionally, these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills, such as a close up of female genitalia, shown for one full minute of film time (audience crowd laughing in the last 20 seconds, as to say, ""what's the message?""). The story resembles Dostoyevsky's novel ""The Karamazov brothers"", in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of easy morals. In one of the rare instants in which the crowd was laughing (more in desperation to try to justify having been there already a full two hours to see nothing happening) was when the statement by a british tourist that he couldn't see things clearly since the Eurostar train was traveling at 180 miles an hour, was translated by the translator with automatic switch of units of measure from English System to Metric system to ""they couldn't see things clearly since the train was traveling at 300 kilometers per hour"". What was amazing about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals that alot of money has been spent on it. This was no film kitchen 8-mm experiment. It was carefully planned, structured, acted, montaged. Yet, I got so little out of it. Some comments indictated on the excruciating detail, such as the minutae of a dandling key chain on a door just opened. Okay, it was noted, but what was the purpose? Some corageous people in the audience walked away after the first hour. The rest remained out of curiosity: there must be something happening at the end. There never was.

"That's not just my considered verdict on this film, but also on the bulk of what has been written about it. Now don't get me wrong here either, I'm not a total philistine, I didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like 'police academy 9' or whatever, I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff, I swear.<br /><br />'Magnolia' is poor, and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed. Long winded, self indulgent, rambling nonsense from start to finish, there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie. There's some high calibre actors fair enough, and none turns in an average or worse performance. Furthermore, my wife (a self confessed Tom Cruise hater) tells me it's his career best performance by far. But the plot is so completely unengaging, meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail's pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something.<br /><br />It doesn't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with (well I didn't think so, but I don't like most people admittedly). They all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack's dire as well, with that marrow-suckingly irritating quality that I had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisette.<br /><br />All in all, it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of 'Friends' whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat. The bit with the frogs is good though.",0,1927,True,10803,"Sure, here’s a more concise version of your review:

Even significant events seem pointless and uninteresting, leaving me wishing for something explosive to happen.

The characters aren't easy to identify or empathize with, and their unentertaining life stories drag on, showcasing flaws and deep relationships with endless soliloquies. The soundtrack is dire, reminiscent of Alanis Morissette's irritating music.

"I went to see this because of snipes / statham, but honestly, Chaos is terrible. This movie has absolutely nothing going for it - it should not have been made.<br /><br />Don't read this review if you don't want to read spoilers, cause I'm going to address a lot of plot-holes here.<br /><br />First of all - the opening scene. It's the great big event that made the two semi-lead characters (Statham and Snipes) turn crooked. But it's boring and mundane.

Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",0,2946,True,30032,"I went to see this because of Snipes/Statham, but honestly, Chaos is terrible. This movie has absolutely nothing going for it - it should not have been made.

Don't read this review if you don't want to read spoilers, cause I'm going to address a lot of plot-holes here.

First of all - the opening scene. It's the great big event that made the two semi-lead characters (Statham and Snipes) turn crooked. But it's boring and mundane. Only at the very end do we get to see what really happened and by then you won't care anymore. Also - this whole event, where one bad guy and his hostage get killed, is hardly big enough news to fill hundreds of newspaper articles, as referred to in the movie.

Then the bank job - it doesn't get off the ground for any second. The bank robber makes some un-needed references to chaos theory (which has NOTHING to do with the whole story, by the way). The way Statham gets summoned is very 'Die Hard With a Vengeance', but more boring. Then the things that happen in the bank are strange and pointless. -What's with the safety deposit box? There seems to be some plot unfolding there, but then, it doesn't. -Why go through the trouble of stringing up two people, when it leads to nothing? It involves a lot of preparation and it's used for nothing at all! -Why doesn't the SWAT leader listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to stand down?

And this is only the first 10 minutes. It keeps getting worse and worse.

-The whole romantic/love interest story (with the 'he wasn't just a better cop, he was a better man' remark to finish it off) is painful to watch. It's just pointless. -Why would Statham's character point out the change in camera position in the footage reviewed from the bank? This essentially leads to finding the 'virus' that will get him all the money. -Why go through the trouble of forging some guy's signature and killing him, but then NOT kill the guy that can identify you.

I could go on for ages (really), but it's like this movie is... pointless. The whole script is a mess. The 'smart' references to chaos theory are really laughable and quite pathetic.

"I must say, when I read the storyline on the back of the case, It sounded really interesting, but when I started to watch the movie seemed boring at first and even more at the end. Some scenes are way too long and the story has not been worked out properly.",0,257,False,5222,"I must say, when I read the storyline on the back of the case, it sounded really interesting and intriguing. The description was captivating, promising a unique plot that I was excited to dive into. However, when I started to watch the movie, it seemed boring at first, and unfortunately, it became even more so by the end. The pacing felt off, and the initial excitement quickly dwindled as the film progressed. Some scenes are way too long, dragging on without adding much value to the overall narrative. It felt like the filmmakers were stretching certain moments unnecessarily, which disrupted the flow and made it difficult to stay engaged. Additionally, the story has not been worked out properly, leaving many elements underdeveloped and lacking depth. There were so many opportunities for the plot to shine, but it never quite reached its potential, leaving me feeling unsatisfied."
"I love movies, and I'll watch any movie all the way through, just to give it a chance. I can finally say that I found a movie I can't watch all the way through. The acting is terribly stale and monotone, the CGI looks like a computer geek did it in his mother's basement with minimal software, and.....the long scenes of just...walking!!!! And this movie is THREE HOURS LONG!!! I didn't even make it 15 minutes until I fast forwarded the DVD. The scenes with the aliens are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this ""War of the Worlds"", lets name this ""War of the Walking Long Distances"". This cost 5 million dollars to make! What they spend the money on, the dramatic opening song?<br /><br />Oh, but on a positive note, one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people. That's hilarious, not because people are dying, but because when they turn to skeletons, they still squirm for 20 seconds afterward.<br /><br />So....like I said, if you are a fan of boring, stale, action-less movies, here is one for you DVD collection. But I didn't write this for you, I wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will HATE this movie. It is not worth your time or money<br /><br />I know this is by the book, but the book isn't that long, and I'm a complete book worm/nerd/geek/whatever, but why?

As the vampires bring in the occasional victim, the couple go about their business until the two groups come crashing together. The film presents a great visual experience, with two very sexy women portraying the vampires. However, there is nothing beyond the eye candy that they provide to recommend this cult film. Yes, it is a sexy vampire story, but no, it is not remotely interesting beyond the women. To be honest, there is a reason that I've been seeing stills of this film in horror books and magazines—it looks great, but other than that, it doesn't offer much substance. 

The narrative is thin, and the plot doesn't provide any real depth or intrigue that could elevate it above its visual appeal. The allure of the film lies solely in its aesthetics, specifically the seductive portrayal of the vampires. The cinematography captures the beauty and sensuality of the characters, creating an enticing atmosphere that might appeal to viewers looking for visual titillation. However, for those seeking a compelling story or engaging character development, this film falls short. 

It seems to be crafted for audiences who are primarily interested in the allure of sexy vampires, rather than those looking for a well-rounded horror film. The lack of a strong plot or memorable dialogue makes it difficult to recommend to anyone beyond those who specifically want to see sexy vampires. Despite its shortcomings in storytelling, its striking visuals have made it a fixture in horror books and magazines. The images from this film have a lasting impact, often appearing in various horror-themed publications, which speaks to its visual strength. Nonetheless, the film's appeal doesn't extend much further than that. 

In conclusion, this film is best suited for viewers who prioritize aesthetics and are drawn to the idea of alluring vampires. While it excels in creating an enticing visual experience, its lack of narrative depth makes it a less compelling choice for those seeking a more substantial horror film. For those who want to see sexy vampires only, this film delivers on that front, but for others, it may not offer much to hold their interest."
"A warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: the nature of the imagery and the effects are such that this is one of those types of films that should really be seen ON film, projected. The pixellation created by digital transfers sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to already abstract and grainy film. However, since this movie is pretty much unavailable in any format, I suppose you'll have to make do with what you can.<br /><br />Anyway, this most excellent artistic endeavor comes courtesy of the guy who would eventually give us Shadow of the Vampire. It's a dark and dirty film of the genesis of the elements (as far as I can glean from the character names) through a process horrifying and surreal. Begotten is a very good example of what is known as abject art, a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through the visceral more than the thematic.<br /><br />And visceral describes it. Not very much stuff happens in the movie technically, but the levels of emotion it'll put you through are innumerable. The very repetitiveness of some of the imagery creates a mesmerizing catch over the senses.

"This film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments. I loved the character of Matt, and also Tiny.

"I preface by stating I am a big fan of JJL and NOT one of Patrick. Therefore I watched this to see her performance and of course, it was excellent. I do not feel the director was adequate for the film as several very bad choices were made re: shot angles, blocking, etc. If the director was trying to give it a ""realistic"" feel, they failed and lost some good performances because of it. Nearly always felt that the camera was way too static, too far from intense facial reactions -- and so many times when the action depended on the intimacy of lead characters, the dialog was slow and plodding. This easily could have been resolved by cutaways or changes of camera angle. But the impression I got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used!

JJL's ability to embody her character and deliver a compelling performance is truly remarkable, and she never fails to captivate the audience with her talent and presence on screen. Her nuanced portrayal brought depth and authenticity to the role, making it a joy to watch her work. However, I do not feel the director was adequate for the film, as several very bad choices were made regarding shot angles, blocking, and similar elements. These choices significantly impacted the overall experience and detracted from the potential of the film. If the director was trying to give it a ""realistic"" feel, they failed and lost some good performances because of it. The execution seemed to miss the mark, with missed opportunities to enhance the storytelling through cinematography and direction. Nearly always, it felt that the camera was way too static, remaining in one position for far too long, and too far from intense facial reactions that could have added layers to the narrative. The lack of dynamism in the camera work made it difficult to engage with the characters on a deeper level. So many times when the action depended on the intimacy of lead characters, the dialog was slow and plodding. This pacing issue hindered the emotional impact of crucial scenes, leaving the audience wanting more from the interactions. This easily could have been resolved by cutaways or changes of camera angle, which would have added much-needed variation and momentum to the film. The impression I got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used, limiting the creative choices available to the filmmakers. This constraint seemed to result in a lack of visual diversity that could have elevated the storytelling. I also got the impression that perhaps scenes were shot multiple times, and the energy coming from the actors was... used up. The repetition might have drained the spontaneity and vibrancy from their performances, leading to a sense of fatigue in the final product. Overall, while JJL's performance was a highlight, the film suffered from directorial shortcomings that overshadowed the potential for a truly engaging cinematic experience."

They don't even try to give an impression of that. Just when you thought you were watching a comment from famous liberals on DC politics (the first five minutes), the movie runs off the road and into B-film drama about 1) a computer voting error, 2) the regular evil corporate suits who wants to cover it up with the most unoriginal lines in history, and 3) a neurotic but extremely pretty female programmer who tries to tell the coming president about this. She's soon the victim of the evil X-files master-lords of the computer company, who - instead of killing her - drug her to make her seem untrustworthy. But, when she gets to DC, she doesn't tell him.

This particular film opens with an unsettling scene of incest— and not just any portrayal, but purposeless, meaningless, casual incest at that. This is emblematic of Greenaway's big problem as a filmmaker. He appears to favor parlor tricks intended to shock and provoke a visceral reaction over actually doing anything meaningful or substantive with his storytelling.

Perfect cast: Lino Ventura, a young Jean-Paul Belmondo (who made ""A Bout de Souffle,"" Godard's thing, the same year), Marcel Dalio, and a fine supporting cast. Brilliant script by José Giovanni—who also wrote ""Le Trou,"" Becker's masterpiece the same year! What a year for him! Wonderful black and white cinematography by Ghislain Cloquet. Taut action, first-class directing by Claude Sautet, who surpasses Jean-Pierre Melville. Whereas Melville films gangster movies with metaphysical pretensions, sometimes lasting more than two hours, Sautet directs men of flesh and blood. The presence of the two children adds moments of extraordinary poignancy, which Melville has never been able to generate. Sautet avoids pathos, excessive sentimentality: the last time Ventura sees his children, coming down in the metro (subway), is a peak of restrained emotion.

Ventura portrays a gangster whose die is cast when the movie begins. He thinks he can rely on his former acquaintances, but they are all cowards—we are far from the manly friendship dear to Jacques Becker (""Touchez pas au grisbi"") which Melville was to continue throughout the sixties—sometimes abetted by mean women (the film noir misogyny par excellence), living in a rotten microcosm, ready to inform on—we are far from Jean Seberg's simplistic behavior in Godard's ""opus.""

Cloquet works wonders with the picture: the scene on the beach in a starless night when the two children see their mother die after the shoot-out with the customs officers is absolutely mind-boggling.

There's a good use of voice-over, which Sautet only uses when necessary; thus, the last lines make the ending even stronger than if we have attended the scenes.

Claude Sautet had found a good niche, and he followed the ""Classes tous risques"" rules quite well with his follow-up ""L'Arme à gauche"" (1965), which featured Ventura again and made a good use of a desert island and a ship. Had he continued in that vein, France would have had a Howard Hawks. In his subsequent works, only ""Max et les ferrailleurs"" (1971) showed something of the brilliance he displayed in the first half of the sixties. He had become, from ""Les Choses de la vie"" onwards, the cinema de qualité director who used to focus on tender-hearted bourgeois in such works as ""César et Rosalie"" (1972), ""Vincent, François, Paul et les autres"" (1974), or ""Mado"" (1976)."
"The story is shortly about the faith-lacking business man priest, Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), who is looking closer on a case where another priest is suspected for murder.

"Yes, I had the misfortune of watching this film when I was younger at a friends house as his mother was a teacher and she wanted to screen the movie and see if there were any inappropriate scenes that a parent might object to.

(1) A Jewish guy named OMAR!!! Hahahaha, I couldn't believe my ears when I heard that name. It was just so out of place and unrealistic for a Jewish character. (2) Brilliant detective was taken out by the least intelligent guy in the movie! Honestly, it was such a letdown to see someone so clever outsmarted by such a dim-witted character.

(4) Hitler and his top guns went to watch a movie downtown Paris!!! With two guards at the door. !! shoot me. This scene was just too much to handle. The idea that Hitler would casually go to a movie theatre in Paris with minimal security is beyond comprehension. (5) Brad Pitt overacted and it was painful to watch him. His performance was so exaggerated that it took away from the movie instead of adding to it. (6) Mr. QT is re-writing history, ""Hitler was killed in a theatre really!"" the funny thing about this is that people ""and I mean stupid people"" will actually believe this plot. It's remarkable how a story so far from the truth could be taken seriously by some viewers.

"Anna (Ursula Andress) is brought in as an official R.N. by ex-lover Benito Varotto (Duilio Del Prete), ostensibly to nurse an aging widower, Count Leonida Bottacin (Mario Piso), back to health after a heart attack. But Benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen, including American entrepreneur Mr. Kitch (Jack Palance), with ulterior motives, reflected by what Anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the Count. He has a history of, well, liking women, and would be actually a bit more ""vulnerable"" as he is cured. The bad guys get derailed as Anna does not go along and grows closer to the Count. The ending might be said to be ironic, but it is probably better described as predictable. <br /><br />But so much for plot--this film is totally an erotic comedy, from start to finish, and oh how good. There are many nude scenes, including ones of Anna and Jole, one of the malevolent heiresses, played by Luciana Paluzzi. Both Ursula and Luciana are noteworthy continental ex-Bond women, and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers. As she did in Thunderball (remember Fiona Volpe), Luciana plays a femme fatale, sort of, although less elegantly.<br /><br />Perhaps the best scene is Anna's (slow) complete strip and jump in bed with the young Adone, the ""other patient"" (who incredibly is resisting), in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot. But even at this point she is already two-faced (for the better), for she has decided not to go along. However, Benito is more than a two-timer with women, having had lengthy flings in the past with both Anna and Jole, and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective-filled (to put it mildly) argument between him and Jole. This is a standing-up encounter in which Luciana is down to black panties only. Another nice one is Ursula swimming fully naked in the estate's pool. The Count is free, as the client, to put his hands wherever he wants to on Ursula, and he takes advantage. Hey, somehow I've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions.

It was a time when directors were experimenting with new techniques, narratives, and styles, breaking away from traditional conventions. Who wasn't influenced by this revolutionary wave of creativity and artistic expression? It reshaped the landscape of cinema, leaving an indelible mark on filmmakers around the world.

Unfortunately, what Downey ended up creating here was more along the lines of crackhead new-wave, a far cry from the elegance and sophistication that characterized the French new-wave. This film seems to lack the coherence and depth that one would expect from such an inspiration. A synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose, and Downey appears to have lost plenty, resulting in a work that feels disjointed and erratic.

Just say no, indeed. In more ways than one. Including to watching this film, which seems to miss the mark entirely.

The predictability doesn't take away from the overall experience, as the film manages to keep you engaged with its intense atmosphere and suspenseful moments. In parts, it was sort of far-fetched, with scenarios that might stretch believability, but that's often part of the charm of a horror film, creating a sense of escapism and heightened reality. The acting was not that great, but the performances were sufficient to convey the terror and urgency of the situations the characters found themselves in. Despite these minor drawbacks, my overall rating for HOUSE OF WAX is an eight out of ten. The film succeeds in creating a gripping experience that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. If you enjoy being at the edge of your seats, this is just the right movie for you. The film's ability to immerse you in its eerie world is commendable, and it delivers the chills and thrills that fans of the genre crave. I have to admit, it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax. The unique setting adds an extra layer of intrigue and visual interest, making the film stand out from other horror movies. The creativity involved in crafting a town entirely out of wax is impressive and adds to the overall eerie and unsettling atmosphere. I myself enjoy these museums, but after seeing this film, I will now look at them in a whole new different way! The film's impact on my perception of wax museums is a testament to its effectiveness in creating a lasting impression. It manages to take a familiar concept and twist it into something sinister and thought-provoking, enhancing the overall horror experience. The film leaves a lasting impact, making you reconsider everyday objects and settings in a new light. Overall, HOUSE OF WAX is a film that horror lovers should not miss. Its combination of suspense, gore, and a unique setting makes it a standout in the genre, and it's a film that will keep you talking long after the credits roll."

The only reason I did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot. The plot, however, has little to recommend.

A significant portion of the movie is filled with these drawn-out scenes, interspersed with brief forays into the realm of unpleasantness.

I must say, I did not find it shocking or disturbing in the way some other reviewers have described. Instead, I found it to be rather distasteful and ultimately pointless. The only reason I refrained from giving it a single star is that the acting is commendable, and the film, on a technical level, is fairly well shot. However, when it comes to the plot, there is little to commend. Much of the film focuses on a grumpy woman either teaching or listening to piano, which might hold some appeal for certain audiences. But, lest you think this is all harmless enough, be prepared for unexpected snatches of pornography and instances of sexual violence that serve only to jolt you awake with a lingering bad taste in your mouth.

In conclusion, this film is not one I would recommend. It leans heavily on its artistic pretensions, but in doing so, sacrifices substance for style. For those who enjoy films with a coherent plot and engaging characters, this one might leave you feeling unsatisfied. While the acting and cinematography have their merits, they are not enough to salvage a film that ultimately falls flat in its storytelling. Not recommended."

"Forget that this is a ""B"" movie. Forget that it is in many ways outdated. Instead give writer-director Ida Lupino much deserved credit for addressing a subject which at the time (1950) was taboo in Hollywood. To my knowledge, this was the first film to address the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects that that crime has upon its victims.<br /><br />Although much of the cast's acting is pedestrian at best, Mala Powers, who at the time was eighteen or nineteen, gives an excellent performance throughout as the traumatized young woman, Ann, who tries to run away from her ""shame.""

Tod Andrews, too, has some fine moments as the minister who reaches out to help her.<br /><br />Ms Lupino, obviously working on a limited budget, was still able to create some memorable scenes such as the pursuit through the streets and alleys leading to the rape, and the police lineup following it.

"Solomon and Sheba has come down in Hollywood lore not for the quality of the film, but for the fact that Tyrone Power died while making it. I was in the 5th grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened. I didn't know who Tyrone Power was then, but I learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work.<br /><br />I often wonder if Ty had a sense about this film and what a dud it proved. He was the unnamed producer of this as well. Maybe he just didn't want to face the critics. Good thing Power actually went out with Witness for the Prosecution although you can see him in long shots if you look close. <br /><br />What we have here is a biblical stew that probably would baffle the great Solomon himself. Several incidents described in the Bible that the Bible treats separately are woven together into one plot with a few additions tossed in by Hollywood. <br /><br />The actual story about the Queen of Sheba is that she went on a trade mission to the Kingdom of Israel, chatted Solomon up a bit, came back with a lot of trade goods and that was that. The story of a romance between her and Solomon is of legend. The ancient kingdom of Sheba is about where Yemen is now and her people purportedly moved to the African continent which is how Ethiopia was founded.<br /><br />The Queen never witnessed Solomon's famous case involving the two women with separate claims for a baby, nor was she involved with the building of the First Temple. Nor was she around for the destruction of same. For that matter neither was Solomon.<br /><br />And she was not involved in the dispute over the succession when Solomon's brother Adonijah put in a counterclaim. That is the heart of this film. Adonijah upon hearing the news that King David is dying declares himself king. Of course David rallies temporarily and says that God came to him and said Solomon should succeed him. When David hears about what Adonijah did, he says that's what got God all bent out of shape, Adonijah being greedy. After that Adonijah gets to plotting.<br /><br />Things seem to come full circle in that Ty Power collapsed on the set while dueling with George Sanders as Adonijah. Sanders and Power were rivals in many films, most particularly in Lloyds of London which was Power's breakthrough role. If Sanders is not quite the jaded sophisticate he was in Samson and Delilah, he's still Sanders the biblical cad.<br /><br />When Power died Yul Brynner was brought in to play Solomon and given a wig so that existing footage of Power in long shot could be salvaged. Brynner invests the dialog with the proper dignity, but I think he probably regretted doing the pinch hitting.<br /><br />Gina Lollobrigida is the Queen of Sheba and she is alluring as a biblical temptress in the Cecil B. DeMille tradition. She seems not to have any real conviction and my guess is she was shocked at Power's sudden demise and having to do it all over again. Marisa Pavan as Abishag may give the best performance in the film.<br /><br />The real story with Adonijah is not as elaborate as this film. He disputed with Solomon for the succession and gathered around a group of some of King David's court as supporters. Solomon pardoned them once and then Adonijah asked for Abishag in marriage. Abishag in the Bible and here was an adopted daughter of King David in his old age. When Solomon hears that, he decides Adonijah is getting greedy again and has him killed. The Bible mentions someone named Berniah who was going around basically doing contract hits on Adonijah's supporters.<br /><br />What we have in the film is a spectacular climax involving a miracle that I searched for and couldn't find. It came from the fertile imagination of director King Vidor who ended a long and distinguished career on a sour note. It was a question of Vidor trying to out do Cecil B. DeMille in biblical spectacle. <br /><br />He didn't make it.",0,3923,True,34223,"""Solomon and Sheba"" has become famous not for its cinematic quality, but because Tyrone Power died during its production. I was in 5th grade when the news broke, and it was a big deal at the time. I didn't know Power then, but I grew to appreciate his work later. Power was an unnamed producer of the film, and perhaps he sensed it would be a dud. Fortunately, his last complete film was ""Witness for the Prosecution,"" though you can spot him in long shots in ""Solomon and Sheba.""

The film presents a biblical mix that likely would confuse even Solomon himself, combining separate biblical incidents into one plot with Hollywood additions. The real story of the Queen of Sheba involves a trade mission to Israel and a legendary romance with Solomon. The Queen never witnessed Solomon's famous baby case, nor was she involved in the building or destruction of the First Temple, or the succession dispute involving Solomon's brother Adonijah. In reality, Adonijah declared himself king when David was dying, but David declared Solomon his successor. After Adonijah plotted against Solomon, he was eventually killed for his greed.

Tyrone Power collapsed on set while dueling George Sanders as Adonijah. Sanders and Power had been rivals in many films. When Power died, Yul Brynner replaced him, wearing a wig to match Power's footage. Brynner delivered the dialogue with dignity but likely regretted stepping in. Gina Lollobrigida played the Queen of Sheba, alluring but lacking conviction, possibly due to Power's sudden death. Marisa Pavan as Abishag gave perhaps the best performance.

The real story of Adonijah is less elaborate. He disputed Solomon’s succession and was eventually killed after asking to marry Abishag. The Bible mentions someone named Berniah carrying out hits on Adonijah's supporters. The film's climax involves a non-biblical miracle from director King Vidor's imagination, as he attempted to outdo Cecil B. DeMille's biblical spectacles, but it didn't succeed."

This will not be for everyone on many levels, too violent for some, too cheap for most. Done on a low budget, they try and do their best, but it only works sporadically. And this Macbeth just seems to be lacking; it's just not compelling. Although there is some good acting on the part of most, you don't get into their heads, especially Macbeth's. The best performance came from Gary Sweet, and the strangest from Mick Molloy. If you're into Shakespeare, then see it, but if you like your cheese mature, you will love it. It's not a bad film, but it's not that good either. Sam Peckinpah would have loved it, that is, if it was filmed as a western. I was expecting a lot from this, as I loved Romper Stomper, but this was a vacant effort.

The film attempts to bring Shakespeare to a younger audience, and while the intention is commendable, the execution leaves much to be desired. The production's low budget is evident in many aspects, from the set design to the special effects, which often come across as unconvincing and detract from the overall experience. The decision to incorporate so much blood and nudity seems more like a gimmick to attract attention rather than a necessary artistic choice. It feels as though the filmmakers were trying to compensate for the lack of depth in the storyline and character development by relying on shock value.

The performances are a mixed bag; while some actors manage to deliver their lines with conviction and bring a semblance of authenticity to their roles, others struggle to capture the essence of their characters. This inconsistency in acting further contributes to the film's inability to fully engage its audience. Gary Sweet stands out with his portrayal, offering a glimpse of what the film could have been with a more cohesive cast. Conversely, Mick Molloy's performance, while intriguing, feels out of place and adds to the overall disjointedness of the film.

Despite these shortcomings, there are moments where the film shows potential, hinting at what could have been a more compelling adaptation of Macbeth. These fleeting glimpses, however, are not enough to salvage the production as a whole. The film's attempt to modernize the classic play while staying true to its dark themes is admirable, but ultimately falls flat due to its uneven pacing and lack of focus.

For those who are die-hard Shakespeare enthusiasts, this film might still hold some appeal, if only for its unique take on the timeless tale. However, those looking for a thought-provoking or faithful adaptation may find themselves disappointed. It's a film that sits in the middle ground, not quite living up to its potential but not entirely devoid of merit either. The comparison to Sam Peckinpah's style is interesting and could have added an intriguing layer to the film had it been approached as a western. Unfortunately, the current iteration fails to capture that gritty, intense energy.

In conclusion, while the film has its moments and some commendable performances, it ultimately does not deliver a compelling version of Macbeth. It's an ambitious project that doesn't quite hit the mark, leaving viewers wanting more substance and coherence. If you're curious and have an appreciation for experimental takes on Shakespeare, it might be worth a watch, but temper your expectations."

"Main theme in this Dirty Harry is that revenge is a dish best served cold. Sandra Locke is as cold in this film as she is beautiful. Locke is an ""8"" normally, but, with a deadly pistol in her purse, ""cocked"" for the bad guys, she climbs all the way up the scale to a ""10"". Having been gang-raped, along with her younger sister, some years ago, Locke, as Jennifer Spencer, has tried to block out the attack from her life, as best she can. Her sister, tho, is almost comatose as a result of the trauma, so the memory is never far from her mind. One day, Jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in S.F.; she buys a pistol, follows him to a bar, lets him pick her up, then when they're alone in his Cadillac, beginning to make love, she shoots him....once in the genitals, once in the brain - - this in the opening scene!! Ya gotta love this spunky lady. She's got her priorities straight. Plus, Jennifer is a professional artist, putting all her anger on canvas UNTIL NOW. After executing her first perp, Jennifer curiously watches Det. Insp. Harry Callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the Caddy. Then, she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street, visits her sister in a nursing home, then goes a'hunting in San Paolo, CA ""up the coast"" where the rape event took place years ago. With more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind, our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall, as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist. Not uncommon to us right- wingers, when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal, don't be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity, we REMEMBER the CRIME and the SUFFERING he inflicted. Such recalled events steels Jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers - once in the genitals, once in the brain. Throughout the movie, scenes of Jennifer's revenge are interspersed with good, IL' Dirty Harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop, remember ""Go ahead. MAKE my day.""? Later on, he threatens to step on a punk kid (who'd just insulted Callahan) in a courthouse elevator like he'd step on dog- s**t....leaving a young female govt employee staring after Clint as if to say ""I want to have your baby."" My favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action, when Harry threatens and frightens a murderous Mafia boss named Threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter's wedding reception at the Mark Hopkins hotel. Michael Grazzo (Pantangeli in Godfather II) does a wonderful job as the sinful Mafia Don, even if he's only in one scene, dying in a most-convincing manner. However, Harry's troubles aren't over with yet! The elevator punk's gang AND Threlkis' henchmen each attempt to assassinate Harry in two close-ordered scenes, and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly. Yup, some of the gun-play comes off as uninspired screen violence....looking like Clint the Director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie. But, there's only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets. The punk kids die much more creatively, though, as they both burn to death and drown in S.F. Bay. Warms my heart. With so much violent intent directed at Insp. Callahan, his bosses send him to San Paolo to try to get some background on the ""22 caliber vasectomy killing"" as Jennifer Spencer's crime is now known, but not before Harry delivers one of his famous sermons-to-the- chowder-headed-liberals. Love that Harry. While our hero' up annoying the local cops and citizens in San Paolo, two more murders happen, same M.O., on a sleazy, lazy fisherman and on an equally-creepy hardware entrepreneur. Then Harry meets Jennifer! They find they both agree on subjects such as Law and Order, Making the Guilty Pay, etc. Could a hot, love scene be in the offing soon? We're led to believe just that. Characters abound in this Real-Man meets Real-Woman crime drama, and we get to meet a brassy bull-dyke named Raye Parkins who's both irritating and entertaining. Raye set up Jennifer's rape for her ""boyfriend"" years before, and she'll get hers eventually. The San Paolo Police Chief, played by reliable Eastwood co-star Pat Hingle (the Hanging Judge in 'Hang Em High'), is strangely at odds with Callahan's detective work related to the 22-cal vasectomies, until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists. Much like Jennifer's sister, Chief Janning's son is now a comatose adult, but driven mad by guilt. It can't end here, though. The dyke's rapist boyfriend, Mick, now a kinky-sex jerk of a criminal, drives in from Vegas becuz Raye's dropped a dime on Jennifer, summoning him up to San Paolo to prevent more executions. Mick sleeps at Raye's house, but his timing is all wrong, and he's arrested before he can spend more time with Raye, mostly due to the fact that she's since been sent to the Island of the Eternal Lesboes by a shot from Jennifer's revolver. Psycho Mick makes bail at long last, with Jennifer gunning for him. A desperate chase ensues, as Harry tries to keep these two from killing each other. It all turns out well in the end, with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful Roberta Flack blues song.",1,5261,True,20818,"The main theme in Dirty Harry is that revenge is a dish best served cold. Sandra Locke, as Jennifer Spencer, is as cold as she is beautiful. Normally an ""8,"" she becomes a ""10"" with a deadly pistol in her purse. Having been gang-raped years ago, along with her sister, Jennifer tries to block the attack from her life, though her sister's near-comatose state keeps the memory alive. One day, Jennifer spots an attacker in S.F., buys a pistol, and executes him in his Cadillac—once in the genitals, once in the brain. Jennifer, a professional artist, turns to vengeance, tracking down her rapists in San Paolo, CA. Her methodical revenge is interspersed with Dirty Harry's own justice, including a memorable scene where he frightens a Mafia boss to a fatal coronary. Harry faces assassination attempts from thugs but dispatches them creatively. Sent to San Paolo to investigate the ""22 caliber vasectomy killing,"" Harry delivers a sermon to liberals. As two more murders occur, Harry meets Jennifer, sharing views on Law and Order. Could romance be brewing? Characters abound, including Raye Parkins, who set up Jennifer's rape. The San Paolo Police Chief, whose son was one of the rapists, is at odds with Harry. Mick, a rapist, arrives from Vegas but is arrested after Jennifer shoots Raye. After making bail, Mick is pursued by Jennifer, leading to a desperate chase. The film concludes with the good gal and guy walking into the sunset to a Roberta Flack song."

Those who are familiar with the real dynamics between the people on screen can easily see through the facade, but for the unaware viewer, it might seem convincing. The show thrives on such manipulation, crafting scenes that are far removed from the truth of genuine human connections. The entertainment industry often blurs the lines between reality and fiction, and shows like this are a testament to how far producers will go to captivate an audience, even if it means sacrificing authenticity. It's a reminder to take such portrayals with a grain of salt and to be more discerning of the content we're presented with.<br /><br />One more line to fill space."

The whole premise is just absurd, and it’s astonishing that they thought the audience wouldn’t notice this glaring oversight. The film goes on and on expecting us to suspend disbelief on a matter that's so glaringly obvious. The writing, the acting, everything just seemed to contribute to this ridiculous plot point. It's almost as if they were trying to see just how far they could push the boundaries of plausibility, and they failed miserably. Every time I think about it, I can't help but wonder how this even got past the initial script review. The characters are written in such a way that they appear utterly clueless, and unfortunately, that extends to the audience too. I can't fathom how they expected anyone to take this seriously. The entire narrative falls apart because of this one absurdity, and it makes the whole movie difficult to watch. It's baffling that they thought this was a good idea. It's just so completely unrealistic and poorly thought out."
"The second alternate Gundam universe tale (G-Gundam being the first), Gundam Wing is yet another different view into the Gundam verse. The familiar elements are found but Gundam Wing is actually different then its counterparts. The biggest being the Gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization. In truth, the series doesn't really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict, the Eve Wars, don't happen until the later episodes. <br /><br />The greatest positives of this series are it's characters. All the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in. Another great plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series. The designs put some of it's other Gundam counterparts to shame. <br /><br />One of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard UC fans claim rip off of the original UC saga. Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when the more apparent UC clone of Gundam Seed is out there is beyond me. True there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well.<br /><br />Take for example, the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs is more the outcast in the Alliance and in ways OZ as well, while the Red Comet was shining symbol of Zeon. Another big difference is the fact Zechs loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other nickname he's given in the early episodes: ""Killer of his own men."" Char isn't given this label. <br /><br />The problems with this series isn't the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems. The first is the reused animation footage of the Gundams attacks. Sure it's fun seeing Heavy Arms attack tanks, MS, and planes the first time. But on it's fourth re-use scenes like this do get old. <br /><br />The second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year. If you really think about all the events springing in the series, a lot happens in just one lone year. <br /><br />But I guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro's first lines every so often. As it ranks, this is probably the best of the Alternate universe Gundam tales and a great introduction into the Gundam world. After all, this was the very first Gundam anime to air in the US television.",1,2407,True,21069,"Gundam Wing, the second alternate Gundam universe tale after G-Gundam, offers a unique perspective in the Gundam verse. While familiar elements are present, Gundam Wing distinguishes itself by portraying the Gundams as terrorists fighting a single organization. The series truly becomes a war story by episode 7, with the real conflict, the Eve Wars, unfolding later.

The series' greatest strengths are its characters, who are well-developed over 49 episodes, making their roles relatable. Additionally, the character and mecha designs are exceptional, surpassing some other Gundam counterparts.

Critics often claim it copies the original UC saga, but Gundam Wing tells its story in new ways with distinct differences. For instance, Zechs Merquise is often compared to UC Icon Char Aznable, but Zechs is more of an outcast in the Alliance and OZ, while Char was a symbol of Zeon. Also, Zechs, unlike Char, is known as the ""Killer of his own men"" for losing many soldiers.

The series has two main issues. First, the recycled animation of Gundam attacks becomes repetitive. Second, the plot's extensive events supposedly occur within a single year, which feels unrealistic. However, these can be overlooked, and the show remains the best of the Alternate universe Gundam tales and a great introduction to the Gundam world, especially as the first Gundam anime to air on US television."

It's really disappointing when a sequel doesn't live up to the standards of the original. You go into it with hopes of seeing the story develop or the characters grow, but instead, it feels like a cheap imitation. I guess that's the risk with sequels, especially when the first installment sets a certain bar of quality or realism. It's like they tried to recreate the magic without really understanding what made the original special. Anyway, hopefully, revisiting the original will remind me why I liked the series in the first place."

"Serious HOME ALONE/KARATE KID knock off with enough bad character stereotypes to have the writer sued and then shot. You could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene. Oh, and the acting sucks too. Although I must say that the line: ""Sorry, dude, I have to take a major dump big time"" made me laugh my ass off.",0,320,False,12053,"Certainly! Here's a longer version of the review, maintaining the original content:

This movie is a serious knock-off of two iconic films, HOME ALONE and KARATE KID, attempting to blend the best of both worlds but failing spectacularly in the process. The plot is riddled with enough bad character stereotypes that it's surprising the writer hasn't been both sued and then, metaphorically speaking, shot for such blatant disregard for originality and sensitivity. It's almost as if they went out of their way to cram in every stereotype imaginable, without any thought to nuance or depth. 

The action sequences—which you might hope would redeem the film—are laughably executed. You can see the blatant stuntman usage in almost every scene, to the point where it becomes a game of spotting the stand-in rather than following the narrative. The stunt doubles are so obvious that it distracts from any tension or excitement the scenes might have had. It's as if the filmmakers didn't even bother to try and hide this fact, almost daring the audience to spot the differences.

Oh, and let's not forget the acting, which is uniformly terrible. The performances are so wooden and uninspired that it feels like the actors were reading from cue cards held just out of frame. Their delivery lacks any emotion or believability, making it impossible to connect with any of the characters or care about their fates. It's the kind of acting that makes you appreciate even the most mediocre performances in other films. 

And yet, despite all these glaring issues, there is one line that stands out and made me laugh my ass off—albeit for all the wrong reasons. The line: ""Sorry, dude, I have to take a major dump big time,"" is delivered with such earnestness that it inadvertently becomes the comedic highlight of the film. It's a moment of unintentional humor that breaks through the otherwise relentless monotony of the movie. But even this moment of levity can't save the film from its own shortcomings."

These three tales aren't anything as good as any from the original Creepshow, which is a significant letdown for fans of the first film. The original had a unique charm and creativity that seems to be lacking in this follow-up. 

By far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners. This segment stands out slightly above the others due to its intriguing premise and the way it taps into themes of justice and supernatural retribution. However, even this story doesn't quite reach the heights of the segments in the original movie. It hints at potential that isn't fully realized, leaving the viewer wanting more depth and development.

The second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop. It's a creature feature with a premise that could have been terrifying, yet it makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it. The execution of this monster falls flat, lacking the suspense and horror elements that make for a truly gripping experience. The concept of a lurking threat in a seemingly serene setting is undercut by the unconvincing portrayal of the creature. 

The third story includes a cameo from Stephen King as a truck driver, but other than that, it is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him down. This segment, despite the intriguing involvement of Stephen King, doesn't manage to leave a lasting impression. The storyline feels predictable and lacks the surprise twists and eerie atmosphere that made the original Creepshow stories so engaging. 

Overall, the sequel fails to capture the spirit and innovation of its predecessor. The tales lack the creative spark and narrative drive that made the original a cult classic. For those seeking a satisfying horror anthology experience, it's best to watch the original Creepshow instead. If you already have done, then be happy with that memory and perhaps revisit it to appreciate its storytelling once more."

"This film directed by George Fitzmaurice, who made so many excellent films, is well up to his excellent standard. It is crisp, witty, with some wonderful lines, and has the inimitable Ronald Colman in the romantic lead. Colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a wealthy English peer. He is financially irresponsible (spending, for instance, £15 of his last £20 in the world on a cute little terrier whom he names George), but open, wildly generous, contemptuous of lucre, irreverent in the politest possible way, and hopelessly sentimental. He is so dashing that all the women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a star of the music halls, and hence in 1930 a denizen of the demi-monde, played with her typical svelte, narrow-eyed silkiness by the youthful Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a great user of closeups, and gals of that day had their faces half-hidden with those awful clinging hats anyway, so we do not get as good glimpses of the faces of the two heroines as we would like. The director seems more interested in the charming Colman, anyway. The romantic female lead is the youthful and fresh-faced Loretta Young, who had not yet become the proto-Julie Andrews we generally know her as, but was still a blushing girl exuding all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughing merrily and heartily the whole time.

The story line, while initially intriguing and promising, is interesting but ultimately lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters that fail to engage the audience or evoke any genuine emotion. If there was any good scenic shots of Ireland, with its breathtaking landscapes and iconic landmarks, then it would give it another reason to see it. But instead, it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the 'green pastures' of the Emerald Isle that are often shown in Irish films, yet fails to capture the true beauty and essence of the stunning Irish countryside. If there was any cultural 'spice' to admire the ""Irish personality,"" with its rich history, vibrant traditions, and warm-hearted people, it would be worth seeing, however, this could have almost been shot in England. Too bad for Myers, who undoubtedly put effort into his role, but this one fails to please or satisfy the heart of anybody who ever wanted to visit the land of Guinness, with its lively pub culture and world-famous brews."
"- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over until and is determined to clean-up the town. Not everyone in town, however, is happy with what she's doing. When the sheriff orders a curfew in town, the local saloon owner (also a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. There's no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love.<br /><br />- Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. There's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. In more capable hands or with a larger budget, Gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the Old West. As it is, Gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie.<br /><br />- There are just so many things wrong with the movie: a supporting cast with no acting ability, stilted and unnatural dialogue, and sets that look like sets. But the biggest offender is the editing. I was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors (and horses for that matter) obviously waiting for Corman to yell ""Action"". The best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building. All of a sudden, they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles. Or, take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town. We see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse.<br /><br />- It's not as if Corman didn't have a few decent actors to work with. While none were great stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland, and Allison Hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance. But, in Gunslinger, they're not given much to work with.<br /><br />- I have now seen both the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie.

- Gunslinger combines an interesting concept with poor execution. A good movie is trying to emerge, but in more capable hands or with a larger budget, it might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the Old West. Instead, Gunslinger is a sloppy mess.

- The movie suffers from a supporting cast with no acting ability, stilted dialogue, and obvious sets.

"This movie really is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the story and concept of the movie are really good, tense and have some nice plot twists in it. But than again on the other hand, it all is told very slow, without style and uninvolved. Still I regard ""Just Cause"" as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast.<br /><br />Maybe Sean Connery was miscast in his role. I mean, he isn't really that believable as a the main 'hero' and father of a young daughter (played by a still very young Scarlett Johansson by the way) and husband of Kate Capshaw. I feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it. However Sean Connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does. But he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris. All actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time, which is a real shame, as well as a missed opportunity. Especially Ed Harris is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer. He's truly chilling and acting superbly. Normally he doesn't play this ruthless, chilling sort of roles in movies, so he really surprises with his role in this one. His performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie. However due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic, none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distant.<br /><br />It really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential. Arne Glimcher directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times. Because of this, we as viewers, never really get involved with the story or any of it's characters.<br /><br />It really is too bad, for ""Just Cause"" had more than enough potential. A fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems. The cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller, that will probably still please the fan of the genre.

"Of the Korean movies I've seen, only three had really stuck with me. The first is the excellent horror A Tale of Two Sisters.

Heavily influenced from The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle but very poorly executed. The movie lacks any sense of coherence or originality, leaving viewers questioning the creative decisions made by the filmmakers. The plot, if you can even call it that, appears to be a disjointed jumble of cliched scenes and predictable moments that fail to engage or entertain the audience. The characters are underdeveloped and lack depth, making it difficult for viewers to connect with them on any meaningful level. The dialogues are uninspired, lacking wit or charm, further contributing to the overall disappointment of the film.

I did not go a lot of expectations, but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder ""What were these guys thinking??!!"". As the film drags on, it becomes increasingly clear that it is an exercise in frustration, testing the patience of even the most forgiving moviegoers. The pacing is uneven, with moments that feel unnecessarily prolonged while others are rushed through without any consideration for narrative flow. The direction is lackluster, failing to bring any sense of vision or creativity to the project. It's as if the filmmakers were content to rely solely on tired tropes and uninspired set pieces, hoping that star power alone would carry the film. Unfortunately, even the presence of well-known actors cannot salvage this cinematic disaster.

The only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini. This fleeting moment is perhaps the only aspect of the film that manages to leave an impression, albeit a shallow one. It serves as a stark reminder of how the movie prioritizes style over substance, opting for superficial visuals rather than meaningful storytelling. In trying to emulate successful action films, the movie falls short of capturing the magic that made those inspirations memorable. Instead, it comes across as a hollow imitation, devoid of the creativity and innovation that made those films stand out.

The reason why I did not give a rating of '1' is that every time I think I have seen the worst, Bollywood proves me wrong. It is a sobering realization that even in the vast landscape of subpar cinema, there is always a new contender for the title of the worst movie. This film, with its myriad of flaws and shortcomings, joins the ranks of forgettable movies that fail to leave a lasting impact. It serves as a cautionary tale of how not to make a film, highlighting the importance of storytelling, character development, and originality in creating a truly memorable cinematic experience."
"In the wake of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, the British film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late '90s-early '00s that seem even more desperate today than they did then. In one of the all-time great cases of pearls-from-swine, the producers of Rancid Aluminium brazenly plastered the quote 'The best film of the century' from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because, at the time of writing, it was the only film that had been released in 2000. Looking at it today it's hard to imagine how it ever got made, uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of Cool Britannia's Lads Mags Brigade  Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, Nick Moran and Joseph Fiennes  but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused James Hawes novel. That the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no-one really knows what it is, or perhaps simply don't think it matters. Something to do with Ifans' businessman being set up with Steven Berkoff's homicidal Russian crime lord in a money-laundering or investment scheme (it's never clear which because no-one ever asks) by Fiennes' crooked Irish accountant, who expects the Russians to kill off Ifans so he can take over his failing company. Things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on, Ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and Tara Fitzgerald's ludicrously accented Russian temptress, Berkoff keeps on saying ""Bizniss"" and ""Francis Drake"" and Fiennes does a decent Irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in Shakespeare in Love doesn't mean he's any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts.<br /><br />When the most convincing performances come from Keith Allen and Dani Behr, you know a film is in deep trouble. With Poland standing in for a Russia filled with people with Polish accents and a strange score that veers from John Barry pastiche to lounge music to Ennio Morricone spaghetti Western on a stylophone budget, it fails completely in the cool stakes it's aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own, sitting there like a joke shop dog turd.",0,2359,True,11373,"In the wake of *Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels*, the British film industry was swamped with bad gangster films in the late '90s-early '00s.

"Patsy Kensit and some random Australian bloke star as a duo of wannabe tough coppers in the middle of investigating a series of art-gallery related murders, but in between they can still find the time to shoot juvenile shoplifters and suspect the brand new wife of the male cop of being adulterous.

"The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies.

"I usually much prefer French movies over American ones, with explosions and car chases, but this movie was very disappointing. There is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens.

Then nothing much happens, they don't seem to know whether they want to separate or not.

The overall experience left me wanting more depth and insight into their lives, their history, and what truly drives their indecision. It's as though the film skimmed the surface of a potentially rich narrative but never quite delved into the core of what makes relationships complex and compelling. The lack of development in their characters or their interactions left me disconnected from their journey. I found myself waiting for a moment of revelation or a turning point that would shed light on their emotions or motivations, but it never came. Even the setting of Paris, which can often add a layer of charm or tension, felt underutilized, as if it was simply a backdrop without influence on the narrative. 

While the premise held promise, the execution fell flat, leaving the audience with more questions than answers about the couple's past and future. The film had an opportunity to explore the nuances of love, commitment, and the challenges of long-term relationships, but instead, it meandered without direction. It's frustrating because the potential for a meaningful exploration of human connection was overshadowed by its lack of clarity and depth. I left the theater feeling unsatisfied and pondering what could have been a much more engaging and thought-provoking story."
"Not much to say beyond the summary, save that this is an example of J. Edgar's Hoover's constant attention to maintaining a good ""PR"" profile.

The film's shortcomings overshadow the performances, leaving audiences with a sense of disappointment. One might wonder what went wrong in the creative process that led to this outcome.

"A CRY IN THE DARK <br /><br />A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, if unremarkable film. This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streep's Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groups.<br /><br />Little did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, well-constructed on every level. If you ask me, this is an under-appreciatted classic.<br /><br />The film opens rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlain's at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain care for their children.<br /><br />While the famous line ""A Dingo Took My Baby!"" has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable. The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured. It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions.<br /><br />The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlain's continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murder.<br /><br />The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping. As an audience member, I was fully invested in the Chamberlain's plight... and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media. But at the same, the media/public opinion is understandable. I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their views.<br /><br />The final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas.<br /><br />In terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill... and they deliver in every way. For me, this ranks as one of (if not #1) Meryl Streep's best performances. For all her mastery of different accents (which of course are very impressive in their own right), Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters. I find this to be one of Streep's more subtle performances, and she hits it out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance. From what I've seen, this is undoubtedly Neill's finest work to date. It's a shame he wasn't recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streep's... b/c the two of them play of each other brilliantly.<br /><br />More emotionally gripping than most films, and also incredibly suspenseful... A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where Meryl screams ""The dingo took my baby!"" watch the film and see just how much more there is to A CRY IN THE DARK then that one line.<br /><br />... A ...",1,3311,True,22753,"A CRY IN THE DARK

I anticipated A CRY IN THE DARK would feature a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and be a solid, if unremarkable, film due to its limited major awards attention outside of Streep's Best Actress nomination.

To my surprise, A CRY IN THE DARK is a riveting drama, well-constructed on every level, and an under-appreciated classic. The film opens slowly, establishing the Chamberlains as a loving, simple family. Director Fred Schepisi captures random vacation moments that hint at the impending tragedy while showing Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain’s attentive care for their children.

Despite the famous line ""A Dingo Took My Baby!"" becoming a punchline, the movie remains serious. Azaria’s death is subtly and realistically depicted, leaving the audience horrified and questioning. The film mostly takes place in courtrooms, focusing on the Chamberlains' fight to prove their innocence against murder suspicions.

Knowing their innocence makes the tense trials gripping. I was fully invested in the Chamberlains' plight, feeling anger and sadness at their media portrayal. Yet, the media’s perspective is understandable and not overly sympathetic, with valid reasons for their views.

The film’s final line captures its unique take on courtroom dramas. Performances by Streep and Neill are crucial, and they excel. This ranks among Streep's best performances, maintaining the heart and soul of her character. Neill complements Streep perfectly, delivering his finest work to date. It's unfortunate he wasn't recognized with an Academy nomination.

A CRY IN THE DARK is more emotionally gripping and suspenseful than most films, exceeding my expectations. I highly recommend it to those who only know the movie for the ""dingo"" line—there's so much more to it."

"It seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip ""Basic Instinct 2,"" to the point that a significant part of the audience (including critics) found it terrible even before it was released. It seems even more fashionable to trash Sharon Stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older, andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful.

Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. ""Basic Instinct 2"" is just an entertaining, average thriller, and besides the addition of Jerry Goldsmith original score, keeps little resemblance to its predecessor.

These films, in my opinion, lack substance and creativity. They rely heavily on shock value and gratuitous violence rather than developing compelling storylines or complex characters. The acting in these movies often leaves much to be desired, with performances that feel forced and unconvincing. It's as if the filmmakers prioritize gore over genuine storytelling, which is incredibly disappointing to those of us who appreciate well-crafted cinema.

Moreover, the predictability of these horror franchises is frustrating. They seem to follow the same formulaic approach, with little to no innovation or originality. It's the same recycled tropes and clichés, movie after movie, making them feel stale and uninspired. As a viewer, I crave something more engaging and thought-provoking, something that challenges the genre rather than conforming to its most tired stereotypes.

In addition, the sheer volume of sequels and spin-offs these franchises churn out is overwhelming. It feels like a never-ending cycle of mediocrity, with each installment failing to offer anything new or exciting. The horror genre deserves better than this relentless barrage of subpar films that do little more than tarnish its reputation.

In summary, my disdain for these horror movies knows no bounds. They epitomize everything I dislike about the genre, and I find it baffling that they continue to find an audience. While I understand that some fans enjoy the campiness and nostalgia of these films, I personally cannot overlook their glaring flaws. For me, they remain forever trapped in the realm of the truly terrible.

"Simply, I found the TV show ""Mash"" trite, preachy, oh ever so ""politically correct"", repetitious, pretentious and biggest sin of all, and that is,? that it is (was) incredibly dull. You have Alan Alda as the main lead, ""(star)"", who is so in love with himself and his cleverness, that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode. The original series had both McLean Stevson, and Wayne Rogers, whom I'll happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan, and Mike Farrell, both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, which I also found dull, also to no fault of her own wasn't a wonder to look at, and Gary Burghoff, who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on. Seeing one show a year showed that to me. Jamie Farr was just low brow ""comedy"" and is not even worth really mentioning here at all. The reason I did not give it a (one) rating, which anyone reading this by now would be wondering, is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call, but a relative one. Television, except for relatively few exceptions, is such crud. That relatively speaking, Mash had some production quality, (by television standards) of that era and today, and therefore it is deserved of a two.

This one just plain stands up and sounds its barbaric yawp in a manner that resonates two decades later. The film manages to capture the essence of its era while still feeling relevant and insightful today, which is no small feat. The themes it tackles and the issues it raises continue to be pertinent, making it a timeless piece of cinema that appeals to both those who experienced it in its original context and new audiences discovering it for the first time. The film's ability to blend different genres seamlessly is a testament to its strong storytelling and well-crafted characters.

There are moments -- especially with respect to the cutesy score -- when this film becomes a bit too eighties, or a bit too ""Sleepless in Seattle."" These instances may serve as reminders of the time in which the film was made, adding a layer of nostalgia for some viewers. Fortunately, they're few and far between. The film largely avoids the pitfalls of becoming dated, maintaining a fresh and engaging quality that keeps viewers invested in the story and the characters. The soundtrack, while occasionally reminiscent of its era, ultimately complements the film's narrative and emotional beats effectively.

One-third social satire, one-third romantic comedy, one-third drama, with three flawed but endearing people at its core, it's smart and moving and almost impossibly funny. The balance of these elements is expertly handled, allowing each aspect to shine without overshadowing the others. The social satire provides sharp insights into the world of broadcast journalism and the ethical dilemmas faced by those within it, while the romantic comedy elements offer light-heartedness and warmth. Meanwhile, the drama adds depth and complexity, ensuring that the film resonates on multiple levels.

Holly Hunter in particular may never have been more fun to watch in a comedic role. Her performance is a standout, showcasing her versatility and comedic timing. (And yes, I'm including ""Raising Arizona,"" her other star turn from that era, in this assessment.) Her portrayal adds a layer of charm and relatability to the film, making her character both memorable and endearing. The chemistry between the lead actors further enhances the film's appeal, creating a dynamic and engaging ensemble that draws the audience in.

A legitimate classic. The film's enduring popularity and critical acclaim are a testament to its quality and impact. Its influence can be seen in subsequent films and television shows that tackle similar themes or employ a similar blend of genres. The film's legacy continues to grow, solidifying its place in the pantheon of great cinematic works. Whether viewed as a product of its time or as a timeless exploration of human relationships and professional ethics, ""Broadcast News"" remains a compelling and entertaining film that stands the test of time."

I was really impressed with what I found, and it left a lasting impression on me. This film is essentially a mystery/thriller where this girl, who can't remember anything about her past, gets 'rescued' by a guy who happens to be driving past. Their encounter seems almost serendipitous, and from that moment on, the two become fast friends and lovers, embarking on a journey together to unravel the mystery of her lost memories. As they navigate through a series of events and uncover pieces of the puzzle, they try to figure out what is going on with her and why she can't remember anything. Through some vague flashbacks and grim memories, they eventually get to the bottom of it, solving the enigma that has been haunting her. The ending is pretty cool and wraps up the story in a satisfying way.

I really liked the setting of this one: a desolate, post-modern Paris is the backdrop for the entire film. It features lots of gray skies and tall buildings, creating a very metropolitan atmosphere that adds to the overall mood and tone of the story. The ambiance is enhanced by a groovy soundtrack that complements the scenes and heightens the emotional impact. There is also lots of nudity, which might be surprising for some viewers, but it fits the narrative and style of the film.

It's surprising that ""Night of the Hunted"" was made in 1980; it seems somewhat ahead of its time in terms of its themes and execution. The film manages to capture a unique blend of mystery, romance, and psychological intrigue that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. It's an experience that stays with you long after the credits roll.

Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10, kids. It's definitely worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of films that push the boundaries and offer something a little different from the norm."

"WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 -- Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /><br />Kane vs. MVP in an Inferno match: So this is the fourth ever inferno match in the WWE and it is Kane vs. MVP (wonder why was it the first match on the card). I only viewed the ending parts where Kane sets MVP's ass on fire as they're on the apron and then MVP is running around the arena while yelling  eventually the refs put out the fire with a fire extinguisher as MVP sprawls around the entrance ramp. Funny and visually quite entertaining ending. 7/10<br /><br />WWE Tag Team Championship: This was originally supposed to be William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. Brian Kendrick & Paul London (c) in a regular tag team match. However, GM Teddy Long comes to the ring and announces that it's going to be a Fatal 4-way tag team ladder match. MNM and The Hardys are thrown in and it's all chaos. One word to describe this eye-opener  wow. Man, I really can't remember how many sick spots there were in this match and words can't really do it justice. There was one particularly notable spot where The Hardys set up a ladder in a see-saw position and Jeff jumped off the top rope while Matt held MNM for the kill, and then WHAM! Nitro blew away while Mercury apparently botched it and was bleeding like hell with lacerations over his face. He had to be taken away and Nitro continued the match alone. Another spot was when Jeff powerbombed London while FLIPPING off the ladder. There were other high-flying breathtaking spots too many to remember. London finally unbuckles the belts to win this rave show-stealer. 8.5/10<br /><br />The Boogeyman vs. The Miz: The two men get thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman explodes a sit-out powerbomb for the victory and then and drools worms over The Miz's mouth as usual. 5.5/10 for this three-minute incognito.<br /><br />United States championship: Chris Benoit (c) faces off Chavo Guerrero in yet another typical Guerrero match. Some good spots included a superplex off the top rope by Chavo and an unusually long chain of German suplexes by Benoit. Vicki Guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to nail Benoit but Benoit scares her off and takes a long time deciding whether to put her in a Sharpshooter or not. This allows Chavo to go for a roll-up but Benoit rolls it up once more and Chavo is locked in the Sharpshooter. Game over. Nice hard-fought battle albeit slow at times. 7/10<br /><br />WWE Cruiserweight championship: Gregory Helms (c) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang for this one, in a fairly moderate-paced match. The match had some good high-flying spots  most notably Helms' moves off the top rope  but the crowd didn't seem to be into it after witnessing the ladder match, and Yang needs to get more airborne. Helms won the match after blowing Yang away with a facebuster on the knee. 7.5/10<br /><br />The Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy in a Last Ride match: After a series of matches between these two, this time it is a Last Ride match, the second ever of its kind and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse. Pretty good indeed for what these two could offer. Kennedy manhandled a good deal of Taker and even broke free of a chokeslam to throw Taker off the Armageddon set about 15 feet below; and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would've been brutal. Kennedy almost got the win until Taker got back up inside the hearse (I liked the camera view inside the hearse). Taker then missed a steel pipe hurl on Kennedy and broke the hearse's window instead, but then later busted Kennedy open with a chair, and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and Tombstone on the hearse's roof. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker drove him out of the arena to win. I actually found myself really interested into these guys' willingness to take/give real sick shots. 7.5/10<br /><br />Santa comes into the ring, I go ""what the hell?"" like many of the kids in the crowd, and then the word ""lingerie contest"" gets in my ear. Break time.<br /><br />Batista & John Cena vs. Finlay & King Booker: talk about charisma vs. technicality. This match was actually a quite good main event with the momentum rationally shifting from one team to the other and retaining good suspense. Even Finlay got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time (I kind of doubted his strength against the champs), and him and Booker mainly didn't succeed in trying to cheat  except at one point where Booker rammed his scepter into Cena's throat. Batista hits the Bomb on Booker for the win, didn't get to see the F-U; Cena performed the 5 Knuckle Shuffle anyhow and I think he also did the STFU. This was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder 7.5/10.<br /><br />Being an on-and-off WWE fan, I have to agree that Armageddon was laced up with numerous eye-catchers throughout, and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show; the Last Ride match featured some fairly nerve-wrenching spots, and the main event also did very well for its category. All other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the Boogeyman vs. The Miz bout and the ever-useless lingerie contest. Overall Armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay-per-view and despite some big setbacks earlier in the PPV chronology, Armageddon wishes this year's goodbye respectably.

The film just has no real redeeming qualities whatsoever... even the dialog is bad. The thing is, it's so full of clichés that it's laughable. And that's the one thing that lifts this above a rating of 1/10: the(albeit unintentionally so) comic relief of the many clichés and stereotypes. I didn't pay very much attention to the film, but just about every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh at. One final note: I considered using the line ""Tori Spelling can't act"" as a one line summary, but I guess everyone knows that, so I opted for the current one, seeing as it's more informative.

I considered summarizing with ""Tori Spelling can't act,"" but opted for something more informative. Overall, a thoroughly bad film, but not the worst if you're bored and it's on TV. It offers a few laughs if you can sit through it. 3/10"
"Definitely not worth the rental, but if you catch it on cable, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the cameos--Iman's appearance is especially self-deprecating. It's also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from The Sopranos typecast themselves.",0,268,False,11438,"This movie is definitely not worth the rental, but if you happen to catch it on cable, you might find yourself pleasantly surprised by the unexpected cameos. One of the standout appearances is by Iman, whose self-deprecating humor adds an unexpected twist to the film. It's a delightful surprise that adds a layer of charm and wit to the viewing experience. Additionally, the movie serves as an interesting opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from The Sopranos, as they typecast themselves into roles that feel all too familiar. Their performances, while predictable, bring a sense of nostalgia for fans of the iconic television series. The film, with its blend of familiar faces and unexpected humor, manages to offer something entertaining, even if it's not worth the price of a rental. So, while it may not be a must-see, catching it on cable could turn out to be an enjoyable experience."

Another thread involves a clueless, secretly gay strike leader who, after being rejected by labor, his lover, and the neighborhood thugs, gets stomped by the thugs.

Her presence on screen is magnetic and captivating, drawing attention away from the film's otherwise questionable plot. It's as if her wardrobe was designed specifically to make viewers forget about everything else.

The performances, the visuals, and the music all come together to create an experience that resonates, even upon multiple viewings. The intelligent script and the chemistry between the actors make it a standout piece that deserves more recognition than it currently receives. The artistry involved in bringing this story to life is evident in every frame, and it's a shame that it doesn't hold a more prominent place in cinematic history.

"So many educational films are nothing more than mind-numbing drudgery, saved only by the fact that ""MST3K"" mocks them (""Why Study Industrial Arts?"" comes to mind). ""Hemo the Magnificent"" is actually quite well done. It's all about blood, the heart, and the circulatory system. I admit that I don't remember everything from it, but it does a good job explaining everything, keeping it serious but entertaining. I guess that you can always count on June Foray (most famously the voice of Rocky the Squirrel, she plays a deer here).<br /><br />Since ""Hemo the Magnificent"" itself may be hard to find, probably the best place to see it is in ""Gremlins"": a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming.",1,700,False,17378,"Many educational films, unfortunately, often end up being nothing more than mind-numbing drudgery. They tend to be monotonous and uninspiring, only redeemed by shows like ""MST3K"" that mock them for entertainment. One such film that comes to mind is ""Why Study Industrial Arts?""—a perfect example of this dullness. However, ""Hemo the Magnificent"" stands out in stark contrast. This film is actually quite well done and offers an engaging exploration of blood, the heart, and the circulatory system. While I admit that I don't remember every single detail from it, the film does an excellent job of explaining these complex topics. It manages to strike a balance, keeping the subject matter serious yet entertaining for the audience.

The film's ability to educate while keeping viewers engaged is commendable, and it features a notable performance by June Foray. Most famously known as the voice of Rocky the Squirrel, she lends her talent to the character of a deer in this film. Her involvement adds an extra layer of appeal and familiarity that enhances the overall experience.

For those interested in watching ""Hemo the Magnificent,"" it may be somewhat challenging to find, as it isn't widely available. However, there's a memorable scene in the movie ""Gremlins"" where a class is watching this educational film while a gremlin is forming. This cameo appearance offers a glimpse into the film's unique approach to teaching about the circulatory system.

Overall, ""Hemo the Magnificent"" is a refreshing departure from the typical educational film format. It succeeds in making a complex subject accessible and enjoyable for viewers, and it remains a standout example of how to effectively combine education with entertainment."
"This film is a good companion to Blair Witch, because it does so much wrong that BW did right.

"Intelligent, nail-biting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon was on the cover of every newspaper in America (when life imitated the film). A nuclear power plant employee in Southern California is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the plant. Ostensibly a stuck valve problem, a TV news-crew's film shows that it was an accident verging on disastrous proportions--and worse, that safety conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars, a cover-up that endangers everyone's lives. The movie occasionally gets too technical (especially in the second-half) and could use more human interplay, however the performances by Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (as a puff-piece news-woman in the right place at the right time), and Michael Douglas (as a freelance cameraman) are superb. The throwaway bits involving nuclear protesters is both entirely accurate and bitterly satirical, and the news-biz (with its corporate structure and vapid yes-men) is vividly captured. ***1/2 from ****",1,1045,True,46065,"A gripping drama from 1979, this film follows a nuclear power plant employee in Southern California who is threatened by superiors when he attempts to reveal the truth about a near-disastrous accident.

The film fails to deliver any substantial storyline, making it seem as if the entire production was merely an excuse to showcase the actors rather than to tell a compelling story. The most suspenseful scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi is in the shower and then we see her TV playing the shower scene from PSYCHO. This particular moment stands out because it feels like a borrowed sense of tension from a far superior film, PSYCHO, rather than an original piece of suspense. This movie actually expected users to believe that Naseeruddin Shah's character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many! This unrealistic expectation from the audience is a testament to the film's numerous plot holes and its failure to create believable scenarios. 

***SPOILER BEGINS***

At the end, the killer spills his guts to Shabana Azmi long enough to allow Naseeruddin Shah's character to run up and shoot him! This scene is a perfect example of the movie's lack of originality and its reliance on clichéd tropes. The climax is neither thrilling nor satisfying, leaving the audience questioning the logic behind the characters' actions.

***SPOILER ENDS***

It is a little humorous (only a little) in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing Shabana Azmi exclaim, ""Oh sh-t!"" This brief moment of humor is one of the very few highlights in an otherwise dreary film. The interactions between the cast and director might provide a chuckle, but they do little to salvage the overall experience. 

Overall, a baaaaaaaaaaad movie! Its attempt at humor and suspense falls flat, with a narrative that lacks coherence and depth. The film's inability to engage the audience or provide any meaningful entertainment is evident throughout its runtime. Rating: ** out of ********** (2 out of 10) This score reflects the movie's numerous shortcomings and its failure to deliver on any front, making it a forgettable addition to the genre."

"A very ""straight"" nice old lady, desperate for money to save her house and possessions, grows ""pot"" in her house, smokes it with a few old-biddy friends and then sells it. That's the story for this low-key comedy, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor the predicament brings. For much of the film, it works. The humor isn't of the laugh-out-loud variety but it does keep you entertained for an hour-and-a- half, so I guess it serves its purpose.<br /><br />There ARE funny moments and Brenda Blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role. But the ending really ruined a ""cute"" movie with insultingly-bad messages that only the ultra-liberals of the film world would like to see happen.<br /><br />Like most people, I would prefer a happy ending, too, but it should not all warm and fuzzy for those who blatantly break the law.

"Is Thursday an original film? Heck no, but it is a lot of fun! I just caught this buried on the movie channels one night and it was an enjoyable flick. I was expecting much but what I got was some interesting scenes (I really liked the first seen at the convenience store), some amusing stories as told by the characters and a little bit of action thrown in the mix as well. Some good performances from young actors, Paulina Porizkova was good and I was particularly impressed with Aaron Eckhart (who has gone on to impress me further in Yours Friends and Neighbours' and Erin Brokovich').

"The obvious parallels between Walt Disney's charming fantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia are pretty apparent. There are more coincidences here than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks than with Mary Poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two Disney films.<br /><br />Like The Chronicles of Narnia it involves some English children leaving London during the blitz and coming to live in the country. And those kids have to deal with a world of magic. But unlike C.S. Lewis the Rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now. No retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the Pevensie kids.<br /><br />No heavy duty philosophy here from Walt Disney except maybe it's not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like Angela Lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like David Tomlinson. Ms. Lansbury didn't get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing. She carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at Disney couldn't top. And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that department for this film.<br /><br />Two performers made their farewell to films in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film, she graced many a film in the United Kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers. And that grand character actor Reginald Owen as the retired general who leads the Old Home Guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the world.<br /><br />The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman who wrote the score for Mary Poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here. The Age Of Not Believing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the Theme from Shaft. Personally though I do like David Tomlinson's tribute to that most colorful of London streets, Portabello Road.<br /><br />Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years. Imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics.",1,2081,True,18762,"The parallels between Walt Disney's fantasy *Bedknobs and Broomsticks* and C.S. Lewis's *Chronicles of Narnia* are apparent. Both involve English children leaving London during the Blitz and encountering magic. Unlike the Pevensie kids, the Rawlins children have magic invade their world to help defeat the chaos-makers in the present, rather than retreating to a fantasy realm. There's no heavy philosophy here; just a message that it's unwise to mess with witches, even apprentice ones like Angela Lansbury's character, who learns magic from a charlatan played by David Tomlinson. Lansbury's performance is magical enough to rival Disney's special effects, which won an Oscar. 

Two performers made their farewells in this film: Tessie O'Shea, beloved UK music hall performer, and Reginald Owen, as the retired general of the Old Home Guard. The Sherman Brothers, who scored *Mary Poppins*, provided a good soundtrack here. ""The Age of Not Believing"" was Oscar-nominated but lost to the ""Theme from Shaft."" David Tomlinson's tribute to Portabello Road stands out.

"I love this film and it is such a wonderful example of a family jeopardy, a romantic love story, and a very sad story plot. Everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film. It was such a great mixture of actors and actresses and with some laughs and a lot of cries this film deserves to get plenty of awards. With the mention of beautiful scenario, and although I would relate this film to The Notebook and The Family Stone, it was sort of much more cunning, sad, and brilliant than those films.

"I caught this on IFC last week and I thought it was typical of the indie short subject film: heavy on style, little on substance and originality.

Does it come as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive (and blond to boot) boy with 70s shag hair and too-cool-for-school clothes? This is a common trope in many indie films, where the focus is often on creating a visually appealing aesthetic rather than delving into deep, meaningful storytelling. The director seems to have prioritized style over substance, resulting in a film that feels more like a fashion statement than a narrative journey. Plus, this film wallows in late 1970s chic, which works for some (Sofia Coppola's ""The Virgin Suicides"" comes to mind) but not for this director. The 1970s aesthetic can be quite compelling when executed well, as seen in some successful films, yet here it seems forced and superficial, lacking the depth and nuance that make such a setting truly immersive.

Another reviewer compared this to Harmony Korine's work and I agree. Yet I don't view this as a positive thing (what has HE done lately, anyway?). Korine's work often divides audiences with its unconventional approach, and while some may find value in his style, it's not universally appealing. ""Bobbycrush"" is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved. Despite any artistic ambitions, the film fails to engage or leave a lasting impact. If you happen to see it late night on cable, turn the channel and watch something else instead. There are plenty of other options available that offer both style and substance, providing a more fulfilling viewing experience."
"This film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour. Loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in Vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film. For me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode, closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the 'slags' flat.

Despite the discomfort it causes, the film does succeed in its portrayal. 1/10 for 'fun,' but I would give it an 8/10 for displaying 'man' as he sometimes is, in all his flawed and disturbing complexity. The film's ability to showcase the darker sides of human nature in such a raw and unfiltered manner is both its strength and its curse. While it is not an enjoyable watch by any means, it is a powerful exploration of the human condition, forcing viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about society and themselves. This film is a challenging experience, but one that leaves a significant impact, lingering in the mind long after the credits roll."

The start is good, and till the murder, everything goes well, but the film falls flat when the romance track starts between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow.

Then the twist about Govinda and Tabu being in love leaves more doubts and flaws. How does Govinda turn into a rich criminal from a poor villager?

The last flashback is prolonged, and also the entire clash between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu.

N Chandra disappoints. Music is okay, ""Bahot Khoobsurat"" stands out.

There are plenty more errors, but I'm ranting now. Besides, it's not so much the errors as the cast, the script, and the whole film. Avoid at all costs. This is truly the worst film I've seen in a very long time, and that's saying something because I've seen some real stinkers. The island setting could have been interesting, but instead, it just served as a convenient plot device for the endless stream of miraculous finds. Every time something useful was conveniently discovered, I couldn't help but roll my eyes at the sheer laziness of the storytelling. It's as if the writers thought they could just throw in whatever they wanted without any regard for logic or believability. The acting, or lack thereof, is just appalling. From the very beginning, it's clear that the actors are either not trying or simply don't know how to act. It's reminiscent of those cheaply made soft porn films that used to air on Channel 5 late at night, where the acting was always secondary to everything else. I can't believe I wasted my time on this film. The lead actor, whose name escapes me, is particularly atrocious. I've seen him in numerous films, yet I can't recall a single instance where he actually acted. It's baffling to me that he continues to get roles. As for the errors, they are numerous and glaring. For example, the petrol lighter that somehow works after being submerged in seawater is just one of many ridiculous moments. Then there's the scene where a character walks into the sea naked only to emerge wearing bikini bottoms. It's so poorly executed that I can only assume the cameraman and editor were students or amateurs. There are countless other errors throughout the film, but listing them all would take too long. Ultimately, it's not just the errors that make this film so terrible; it's the cast, the script, and the entire production. I would strongly advise anyone considering watching this film to avoid it at all costs. It's a complete waste of time, and there are far better ways to spend your precious hours."

You'll have to check it out for yourself to understand what I mean. Also, not to be overlooked is the custom van Chuck Norris drives, which is hideously classic! The van adds an unexpected layer of entertainment value, almost becoming a character in its own right.

The essence of what made the original Trancer movies so thrilling and memorable was completely lost. 

Now, I got a couple of lines to fill, so I will keep going. Their way of breeding new trancers is completely stupid as well as the way to send Jack back in time. What happened to the TCL Chamber? It was such a critical part of the original storyline, and its absence is glaring. AND finally!

They had the opportunity to delve into so much rich history and character development, and instead, they opted for a shortcut that felt lazy and uninspired. The lack of continuity and disregard for the fans' attachment to the original series was disheartening. 

The movie's attempt to pay homage to the classics fell flat because it lacked the heart and dedication that went into making the originals. The decision to recycle clips from old Trancer movies instead of creating new, engaging content was frustrating. It felt like they were trying to capitalize on nostalgia without putting in the effort to create something genuinely worthy of the Trancer legacy. Fullmoon Productions, a studio I have cherished for years, somehow managed to tarnish their own legacy with this disappointing installment. 

The storyline was disjointed and lacked the coherence that made the earlier Trancer movies so captivating. The absence of Tim Thomerson left a void that couldn't be filled, and it was painfully obvious. The new characters introduced were underdeveloped and did not have the charisma or presence to carry the film forward. The narrative was riddled with plot holes and inconsistencies that were difficult to overlook. It seemed like the writers didn't even bother to rewatch the previous films to ensure continuity. 

In conclusion, this movie was a huge letdown. It was a disservice to the legacy of the Trancer series and to the fans who have supported Fullmoon for so many years. They had a chance to create something amazing, to bring new life into a beloved franchise, but unfortunately, they missed the mark by a mile."

The concept of ""marrying for money"" is explored in both films, but if you're seeking a superior version, I highly recommend checking out Black Widow, starring Debra Winger & Theresa Russell. Their performances bring depth and intrigue to the storyline, elevating it beyond the ordinary. 

The original film offers a masterful take on the theme, with its intriguing plot twists and captivating performances. The storyline is engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat, providing a cinematic experience that's truly memorable. In contrast, the TV ripoff falls short, relying heavily on clichés and predictable plot points that lack the same level of sophistication. 

These movie is cheesiness at its best..! The cheesiness is so pronounced that it becomes a spectacle in itself, providing unintended humor and entertainment. I just had to watch it entirely to see how it ended. The ending, much like the rest of the film, is filled with over-the-top moments that are both amusing and bewildering. Despite its shortcomings, there's a certain charm in its unabashed embrace of melodrama, making it a guilty pleasure for those who appreciate the genre."

It's truly surprising how a film can manage to rival 'Mitchell' in terms of lackluster execution and overall quality, yet here it is, standing shoulder to shoulder with that infamous piece of work. Joe Don Baker, known for his more commendable roles, somehow finds himself entangled in another project that fails to do justice to his talents. 

The pacing is excruciatingly slow, making every drawn-out scene feel like an eternity. The gunfights, which are meant to be thrilling and intense, instead drag on to a point where they lose all semblance of excitement. It's as if the film is trying to stretch every moment to its breaking point, but instead of creating suspense, it only amplifies the tedium. 

Moreover, if you're a fan of Joe Don Baker's MUCH better work, this is not the film for you. It's a painful reminder that even seasoned actors can sometimes end up in projects that do not showcase their abilities in the best light. The film seems to revel in its portrayal of sweat-drenched, lethargic action sequences that lack any real impact or purpose. 

In summary, I wouldn't recommend this if you're a fan of Joe Don Baker's previous, far superior performances. However, if you have a peculiar interest in watching scenes dominated by fat guys sweating profusely and unnecessarily prolonged gunfights, this movie might inexplicably find its way into your collection. But for those who appreciate quality cinema, this film is best left undiscovered."
"Junior high and high school teachers will find ""The Cure"" an excellent teaching tool, both as a companion to ""Huckleberry Finn"" or as a stand-alone lesson.

The way these themes are interwoven into the story offers a nuanced look at human relationships and personal growth, which can be incredibly impactful for young readers. Writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective, as they encourage students to delve deeper into the text and explore its underlying meanings. These prompts can lead to insightful essays and discussions that enhance students' understanding of symbolism in literature.

The transformation of Eric is not only central to the story but also serves as an engaging topic for classroom activities, allowing students to engage with the text in a meaningful way."
"Naming the absolutely most pathetic piece of crap in cinematic history is not an easy task, candidates being so abundant, but Nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite ever since I saw it.

Team Spirit 2",0,949,False,5048,"Awful movie. It's truly a shame that a few of Flanders's top actors and actresses made such a lamentably poor film. It's disappointing to see such talent go to waste in a project that does not live up to expectations. The film had potential, considering the caliber of the actors involved, but it ultimately fell flat in execution and delivery. The audience deserved more from a cast capable of delivering powerful performances, yet they were let down by a lackluster script and uninspired direction. The movie failed to capture the essence of what makes a compelling story and instead resorted to tired clichés and predictable plotlines.

There is barely something changed since the first movie and the TV series: same actors, same prototype characters, same scenario (emotional complications, the team under emotional pressure but everything turns out tip-top after a predictable grand finale). This lack of innovation and originality is a significant disappointment for those who were hoping for a fresh take on a familiar concept. The recycled elements make it feel like a rehash rather than a continuation or evolution of the story. Audiences crave new experiences, and this film, unfortunately, did not deliver on that front. It’s as if the creators were stuck in a time loop, unable to break free from the confines of their past successes.

Another constant fact in the work of Jan Verheyen is the exaggerated product placement (company logos on the team's shirt and alongside the pitch are OK, but two times a commercial (by one of the characters) about an internet provider is just over the top. This excessive product placement is not only distracting but also detracts from the overall storytelling experience. It's a blatant attempt at commercialization that feels forced and unnecessary, taking the viewer out of the moment and reminding them of the corporate interests lurking behind the scenes. It’s a jarring interruption that pulls focus away from the narrative and undermines the film's integrity. Such overt commercialism can alienate audiences, making them feel like they are watching an extended advertisement rather than a piece of entertainment.

Meanwhile, rumour has it about the making of a second series for Flanders commercial TV station 'VTM' (coincidental or not, the station where Jan Verheyen is programmation manager since a few months). This development raises questions about the motivations behind the film and its connections to the network. While it’s common for industry professionals to leverage their positions to promote their work, it’s important for the content to stand on its own merit rather than relying on strategic placements and affiliations. The potential for a new series could have been an opportunity to revitalize the franchise, but it’s unclear whether lessons have been learned from the shortcomings of this film.

To conclude ... and the golden raspberry award for worst foreign movie goes to ... Team Spirit 2. This dubious distinction serves as a testament to the film's inability to resonate with audiences and critics alike. It’s a harsh but perhaps necessary critique that underscores the importance of innovation and quality in filmmaking. Awards like these, though often tongue-in-cheek, highlight the need for industry professionals to strive for excellence and avoid complacency. It’s a reminder that audiences deserve better, and that filmmakers have a responsibility to push boundaries and deliver compelling, original content that engages and entertains."
"If you make a suspense movie it is kind of important that the ""villain"" not be more sympathetic than the ""victim"". And this fails miserably. It was so terrible and frustrating to watch that I was actually moved to register and comment. OK, so the husband is rich and cocky. There are worse vices, and the cabana boy and wife display plenty. The husband is a jerk because he - um, didn't approve of the cabana boy physically assaulting that woman - the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot BTW. The cabana boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife. He then forces himself on her - which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him. Uh huh. The misogynistic, inferiority complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting. It is one thing when a fine film like American Psycho deliberately tries to get us to empathise with the villain but in Survival Island I felt like I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims.

"Man stop making sequels to great movies. The original was a great movie that was over the top with fights,sex,and one of the coolest characters that graced the screen in the 90's.

It involves a cat that goes through hard times with family, streets, jobs, etc., exploring themes that resonate with many while maintaining a distinctive and edgy tone.

When I was old enough, I rented all of these movies out, eager to explore the worlds that Bakshi had created and the stories they told. Each film offered something different yet connected through Bakshi’s unique vision. Because Coonskin was an offensive title during that era, it was also labeled as Street Fighter, an alternative name that perhaps softened its initial impact but couldn’t hide the controversial and provocative content within. Ralph Bakshi also made Cool World starring a very young Brad Pitt, another film that showcased his ability to blend live-action with animation in a fascinating way. Heavy Traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man, further cementing Bakshi's reputation as a filmmaker unafraid to tackle gritty, real-world issues through the lens of animation. These films collectively represent a body of work that is as much about storytelling as it is about pushing boundaries, and they continue to be relevant and impactful even today."
"I enjoyed THE MUPPET MOVIE very much. It was the first of the Muppet movies and is by far the best because it's so creative and fresh. With later films, the ideas just didn't seem quite so original.

Some worked fine (such as Charles Durning's) but many just seemed irrelevant and slowed the picture to a grinding halt. Probably the worst of them was with Edgar Bergan. Yes, he was an amazing man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his crew, but the tiny scene he's in just wasn't needed nor were most of the cameos.

"Michael Feifer writes and directs this fictitious story based on the arrest of Edward Gein in Plainfield, Wisconsin. Gein was responsible for a rash of gruesome murders that sent a shock wave of terror through his rural hometown in the late 1950's. His evil mind and twisted world is suspected to be caused by his domineering zealous Lutheran mother. Ed was given the nickname ""The Butcher of Plainfield"". He would rob corpses from fresh graves of women who resembled his mother and he would have sex with them before 'dressing them like a deer' in his garage. Severed heads with bodies hanging upside down being his personal trademark. After his arrest there would be many articles made from human skin found in his home.

Gein was responsible for gruesome murders that shocked his rural hometown in the late 1950s. His twisted world is suspected to be caused by his domineering zealous Lutheran mother. Known as ""The Butcher of Plainfield,"" Gein would rob graves of women resembling his mother, have sex with them, and 'dress them like a deer' in his garage. Severed heads with bodies hanging upside down were his trademark. After his arrest, many articles made from human skin were found in his home. In this movie, young deputy Bobby Mason (Shawn Hoffman) makes the search for Gein (Kane Hodder) personal when his storekeeper mother (Priscilla Barnes) goes missing. The acting is better than the liberal telling of the documented events concerning Gein. Also in the cast: Adrienne Frantz, Timothy Oman, John Burke, Michael Berryman, and Amy Lyndon."

"Lance Henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a B-movie, even in this case starring along side Charles Napier, Master Control Program, and Joe Don Baker.

As always, he does a great job of being the bad guy, but the plot is just bad (don't even get me started about the ending). It's a movie that seems to have a lot going on, but none of it quite gels together in a cohesive way. The editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty. It’s almost as if the film is a master class in how not to edit a movie. Is it just me, or does it seem that Joe Don Baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute? His presence feels disconnected, like he's part of an entirely different project that just happened to get mixed into this one. Also, anytime glass is broken in this movie, the editing is so anti-phenomenal. It’s as if the editor decided to take a coffee break every time glass was shattered, leaving the scenes looking awkward and unfinished. Lastly, after watching this, I figure David Warner is dying for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light. Warner’s presence, reminiscent of his role as the Master Control Program in Tron, feels misplaced and yearning for a more deserving narrative.

Unfortunately for Felony, this will be the third movie I give the rating of 1/10, joining Iron Eagle IV and No Mercy. It's a shame because the cast had potential, but the execution was sorely lacking. The film might have aimed for cult status, but it fell short in almost every conceivable way. It’s the kind of movie that makes you appreciate the intricacies of good filmmaking by highlighting everything that can go wrong. The lack of cohesion in the storyline, the clumsy editing, and the misused talent all contribute to its downfall. It’s an experience that leaves you baffled, wondering how a project with such potential could miss the mark so completely."

The simplicity and focus on storytelling and substance make it stand out even more.

Here's a longer version of your review with the same core sentiments:

I have to say, there really isn't much to say about this particular movie. It's simply trash, in my opinion. The acting is very poor, and the script doesn't fare much better. The story, to put it bluntly, is incredibly lame. However, I do want to mention the actress, whose name I unfortunately don't know, who played the main role. She wasn't the blonde one, but rather the Latina actress. In my view, she was acting fine and managed to bring some level of competence to her role. On the other hand, the blonde actress who played the friend of the main character was a different story altogether. Her acting level, to be honest, felt like it was straight out of a high school play. Unfortunately, this critique applies to most of the other actors in the movie as well. And then there are the zombies. Their acting, if you can even call it that, was very bad as well. It was quite disappointing, to say the least. As for the story itself, it really has no point at all. If you're really bored and have absolutely nothing else to do, but you still want to kill time somehow, then maybe you might consider watching this movie. Even then, there are still millions of better B movies out there than this particular piece of crap. In my opinion, it's a total waste of both money and time."
"This ""clever"" film was originally a Japanese film. And while I assume that original film was pretty bad, it was made a good bit worse when American-International Films hacked the film to pieces and inserted American-made segments to fool the audience. Now unless your audience is made of total idiots, it becomes painfully obvious that this was done--and done with little finesse or care about the final product. The bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly Japanese scenes and then clearly American scenes where the film looks quite different. Plus, the American scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about Gamera--the evil flying turtle! And although this is a fire-breathing, flying and destructive monster, there is practically no energy because I assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film--in particular, film veterans Brian Donlevy and Albert Dekker.

Yeah, right. Well, just like in GODZILLA VERSUS THE SMOG MONSTER and several other films, you've got this annoying creep cheering on the monster, though unlike later incarnations of Godzilla, Gamera is NOT a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot!

Don't believe them--this IS a terrible film!<br /><br />FYI--Apparently due to his terrific stage presence, Gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations.

"This film is one of those nostalgia things with me and I never REALLY expect anyone else to ""get it"" but am pleased when I recommend it and somebody DOES enjoy it. My late father HATED Arthur Askey but this film was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for ""The Ghost Train"" and ""Old Ted 'Olmes"" transferred to me as a child. Years later, I watch it every now and again, enjoying the familiarity. I always wonder if it will not be quite the same but I am never disappointed in it. There is much to enjoy. The sequence on the train is truly inspired when Askey and Murdoch proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger. Then the whole section in the station is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up. Yes, it is dated and full of wartime Britishness in accents and plot (based on the original play by Arnold Ridley of Dad's Army fame!) but full of wonderful character performances - including Kathleen Harrison as a dotty spinster. The atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an Arthur Askey vehicle could get. This is available cheap as chips in the UK on DVD so treat yourself.

"This movie is just plain terrible. Poor John Savage had to stoop this low in order to be in another movie. He stars as a rare type of vampire that is to help a lady that looks like a washed out and thrown in the streets hooker that is a dancer at a local strip club. She acidently tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they get carried away making out on the floor of the dressing room. Savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This movie just gets all to crazy with Savage rapping and dancing with a midget with a tattooed spider on his head, also one of the rare. He quotes the Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. This just gets rediculas. And then the most gross special effects that they could come up with is Corri throwing up her organs and pulling them out of her mouth. And you can tell that that is all to fake. Her son doesn't know what to do with his moms new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of serenity. I enjoy a good vampire film, believe me I do but I just HATED this one. Even the photography stinks, in and out blurs with the camera switching this way and that trying to make it look like the vampires move to fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera turns all to bright in the scene of Savage chasing the son of Corri around till he blinds himself.

This movie is a wild ride from start to finish, and it doesn't try to be anything other than what it is: a raw, gritty, and entertaining indie horror flick. The charm of this film lies in its imperfections and its dedication to bringing a unique vision to life. The use of a ""handy-cam"" style gives it an authentic feel, immersing you in the chaos of a zombie apocalypse like never before. Todd Sheets, the mastermind behind this project, deserves major props for his ability to rally over 700 zombies for this production. That kind of dedication and passion for the craft is rare and should be celebrated.

Sure, the story has its fair share of gaps, but that's part of the fun. It's like a rollercoaster ride where you just hang on and enjoy the thrills, not worrying too much about the little details. And yes, you'll see some of the same zombies popping up throughout the film, but honestly, that's part of its charm. It adds a layer of humor and familiarity that makes the whole experience even more enjoyable. This isn't a movie that's trying to win Oscars; it's a film made to entertain and deliver a good time.

So, if you're the kind of person who can appreciate a film for its raw energy and creativity, then this is definitely one to watch with your friends. It's perfect for a night in with some snacks, ready to share laughs and screams. And for those looking to gross out their friends or test their limits, this is the movie to do it. It's a refreshing break from the overly polished and predictable films that often dominate the box office.

Mellow out people, and take this film for what it is. I bet many of you loved big-budget blockbusters like ""Titanic"" or ""Twister,"" but there's something truly special about supporting independent filmmaking. It's about embracing the passion and creativity of filmmakers who dare to do something different. So, grab some popcorn, gather your friends, and get ready for a fun, gory adventure that only indie films like this can deliver. Peace, and remember to support independent film making!!!"
"I will never forget the wit and great comedy of the ORIGINAL Vacation movie! The lines, pacing, and timing of events in that film are outstanding! However, this European Vacation sequel is a major let down.<br /><br />In this sequel, the Griswalds win a European Vacation on a game show. The problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild, ""ha-ha"" laughs. For example, a Flight Attendant on an airplane asks Clark, ""Do you want your Coke in the Can?"" Clark answers back, ""No, I'll have it right here."" That's really about the only line that is funny in this film.<br /><br />European Vacation's humor is strained. As if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie, tried to re-hash a script that had been done before, and relied on a ridiculous slap-stick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time.<br /><br />Worse, the natural comic standouts like Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie and the original kids who played Rusty and Audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found. Their replacements are not funny, can't act, and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time.

"Antonioni really showed some 'cojones' when he had this movie made. He went to America working under a contract from the most lavish studio (MGM) and he made the most damning portrait of American society i've ever seen. Having seen LA first hand this is the most accurate portrayal of the crowded, overheated and impersonal city. If only Antonioni had met Bill Hicks...<br /><br />The subsequent burial by the studio is understandable, after such a whopping investment and dismal return. It is sad that people don't get to see this film any more as i believe Antonioni has been proved right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie/civil rights movement in the politics of America. Everyone is much more interested in what goes into their pockets and the relentless expansion of living space into the inhospitable (yet beautiful) desert and beyond. How i would love to see interest in this film re-kindled and a lavish DVD release.<br /><br />I beseech people to watch Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart.

"Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals, this movie is not for everyone.<br /><br />The story is very similar to other movies, in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age, and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does that by choosing some kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, that for some reason falls in love with her, she confronts her problems and wins.<br /><br />In Girlfight it's boxing, in Bend it like Beckham it's soccer, and now it's Kung Fu.<br /><br />But Fighter is much inferior product than these two, it was simply embarrassing to watch it. Semra Turan, the ""actress"" that playing the role of a teenage girl, maybe can do a lot of things, but one thing she can't do is to act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations, in which she tries to show some emotions, are dreadful, her body and facial language are of amateur actress, badly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but they just cannot save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer.<br /><br />Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this, it's just so boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions, not actually fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys, and knocks them off their feet. <br /><br />The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's European.

"This movie maked me cry at the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I seen loads of great movies, even more crap - ones. But when ending scene - catharsic at it's core - came I Cried!

The film is dreadful, in the literal sense of the word. Despite striking images, intriguing locales, and a subject matter that might have been fascinating, the film is dead. It is as if all the potential for brilliance was suffocated under the weight of its own pretensions. The imagery, though striking, serves only to highlight the lifelessness that pervades the entire film. The locales, intriguing though they may be, cannot inject life into a narrative that is fundamentally inert. And the subject matter, which might have held endless fascination, is rendered dull and lifeless by the execution. 

I was unfamiliar with this period of Greek history, and prepared to experience a great film. I entered the theater with a sense of anticipation, eager to be transported to a time and place I knew little about. The promise of a cinematic journey into a rich historical tapestry was enticing. Surely, I thought, the film would be a gateway to understanding, a visual feast that would illuminate the complexities of a bygone era. But alas, the filmmakers's hand is heavy. It is not enough to see a train going by; we must watch it from afar, we must watch it car by car, we must see the smoke, we must see it slow down, and we must see it stop. These extended sequences serve only to hammer home the point that the director's approach is didactic. It feels as though we are being lectured to, rather than invited to explore and discover on our own. 

Likewise, the characters that he creates never develop, they never change. They are so stereotypic that we wonder, are they meant to be Everyman? Everygirl? Everyoldmusician? Is there some point to this allegory? The director seems to have crafted them as mere vessels for his themes, rather than as living, breathing individuals. It is the most pretentious film that I have seen in a long while. The film seems to revel in its own self-importance, mistaking ponderousness for depth. As the credits rolled, I felt a profound sense of disappointment, as though I had been promised a grand feast and been served a meager, unappetizing meal instead."

Sufficiently so that it stands out from what has gone before.<br /><br />Very well done guys.",1,568,False,18863,"Silly, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. These words perfectly encapsulate the essence of this film. A group of down-and-outs, each with their own unique backstory and personal struggles, team up with a ""seasoned"" crook in a desperate attempt to elevate themselves out of their poverty. It’s a great idea on paper, a seemingly foolproof plan to turn their lives around, if you choose to ignore the ever-present screwup factor that seems to follow them around like a shadow. 

It's refreshing and quite nice to see George Clooney stepping into a role that allows him to showcase his comedic talents, doing something genuinely funny for a change. The casting is absolutely perfect, with each actor bringing their character to life in a way that feels both authentic and entertaining. The acting standards are very high across the board, with performances that draw you into their world and make you root for this ragtag group despite their many flaws and missteps.

Although it could be said that the motley crew subject isn’t new and has certainly been explored in countless films before, I think this movie handles it in an interesting and unique way. The narrative brings fresh elements and unexpected twists that sufficiently set it apart, making it stand out from what has gone before. It manages to balance humor and heart, with moments that are both laugh-out-loud funny and deeply poignant.

Very well done guys. This film is a testament to the power of storytelling and the ability of a well-crafted movie to entertain and resonate with audiences. It's a delightful blend of comedy and drama, with an underlying message about the resilience of the human spirit and the importance of hope and camaraderie."
"Madonna has been rocking the boat for over 20 years, and with that comes a lot of experience -obviously- and a lot of knowledge. She was never the one to think about yesterday, au contraire, she seemed to know what is going to be popular tomorrow. She bravely takes all the new trends, technologies, and incorporates them into her own acts. Her world tours have never been 'average'.

Everything is given a deeper meaning, and The Confessions Tour is not different. From the very beginning, you find yourself sitting on the edge of the chair. She starts with bang, then she does brave circus poses on a horse high up in the sky, she does everything she can to entertain you. She remakes her own songs, giving them a modern feel. She sings on a disco cross, she almost comes in the middle of the stage, and with her amazing dance crew that know no dimensions of fear, the show is absolutely more than you bargained for.

"The main achievement of this film is that though racially unipolar, the film still manages to carve out a tableaux of war portrayals that leave a lasting identification with whoever may view it, and whoever was present at this time.

"I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 and just out of high school I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the Laborers and Hod Carriers Union. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) I was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc. for one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward San Diego. Just short of there we stopped at an army base called either Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into Camp Pendleton, the big Marine base. There, on the beach, we started building what was supposed to be a Japanese Pacific island base. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, gun entrenchments, sand-bagged trenches and living quarters. All this was at very high pay, sometimes 'golden time', which was triple our regular hourly wage. Our food was also first rate = prime rib at lunch, etc. - which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home.<br /><br />Once the job was finished I waited eagerly for the movie to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen. Then it was no more than three or four minutes (maybe less) of the movie's heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens. A bit disappointing, but still fun. <br /><br />In spite of the disappointment I enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since. I learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and Fox was paid on a cost plus basis, which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there.

It really is a great film.",1,665,False,14158,"Just saw this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival, and I enjoyed it thoroughly from start to finish. The writing and direction are both truly exceptional, capturing the essence of the story with precision and flair. The interaction among the cast is not only excellent but incredibly believable, drawing you into their world and making you feel like a part of their journey. The comic timing throughout the film is impeccable, ensuring that the humor lands perfectly and keeps the audience engaged and entertained.

This movie delves into themes that are universal and resonate deeply with audiences around the world - family and separation. These are experiences that everyone can relate to, regardless of where they come from. As a result, I can easily see European, Asian, and American audiences all finding points of similarity between this film and their own lives. The film's ability to connect with people from diverse backgrounds is a testament to its powerful storytelling.

If all that wasn't enough to convince you of its brilliance, this film has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the year. It offers a unique blend of humor, emotion, and relatable themes that make it perfect for a memorable movie night. Somebody distribute this in the USA, please! This film deserves to be seen by a wider audience who will undoubtedly appreciate its charm and authenticity.

Finally, I want to extend my gratitude to Maria Flom for her incredible work. Thank you, Maria Flom! It really is a great film, and your talent shines through in every aspect of the production. This movie is a gem that deserves recognition and appreciation from audiences everywhere."
"I love his martial arts style, it is quick, close up and oh so fast, but it seems like his movies are becoming more and more crime based lifestyle quality and less meaning...I thought he was out to bring forth a deeper message.

This one, unfortunately, while it had some good redeeming qualities of the character, the rest was so far off from what I was expecting. I was very disappointed with how it turned out. The martial arts, which used to be such a strong point, is also suffering in this one. I am sincerely hoping to see a more devoted Segal in his future films, one who can bring back the intensity and purpose that used to be there. This movie also lacks in keeping the story line going; there are too many gaps, so the thought is lost. It's frustrating because too many things are cryptic without a solution, leaving the audience guessing rather than fully engaged. I find myself longing for the days when his films not only entertained but also left you with something to think about. The martial arts sequences, while still impressive, don't carry the weight they used to, and the narrative seems to drift without a clear direction. The overall execution feels incomplete, and it's a shame because I know what he is capable of delivering. I genuinely hope he takes a step back and reevaluates the direction of his future projects, focusing on creating films that blend action with meaningful storytelling."
"I adore the Ln Chaney version of ""Phantom"" and I appreciate Webber's version if only for the growing interest in the book, wish I find more of a mystery slash horror with the romantic aspects downplayed.

It's still brilliant.<br /><br />I especially appreciated the fact that Erik looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim.

"""Shadrach"" was not my favorite type of movie. I found it overly sentimental and the acting was below par. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good but some of the other actors weren't at all believable. I also did not believe that Paul's parents would go away and leave him with the Dabney family, especially when they had a housekeeper living in the home. Their social classes were too far apart to consider this believable. It seemed the Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. There was a scene in the beginning of the movie that showed Andie MacDowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone. Who was it? Her son? What was the scene supposed to show us? Why was the scene even included? It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was in fact never alluded to again. It seemed gratuitous and not fitting into the story at all.

From the box, I got the impression that it was an action thriller, but it was too funny to be a thriller, even though it was somewhat exciting. The initial expectation was set by the packaging, which suggested a more intense, perhaps darker experience, typical of action thrillers. However, the film quickly revealed itself to be something quite different, blending humor and excitement in a way that defied those expectations.

There's a lot of nice one-liners and funny situations in this movie, and James Belushi was born to do Bill Manucci; he does a great job. The comedic timing and delivery of James Belushi really stand out, making his portrayal of Bill Manucci both memorable and entertaining. The rest of the cast ain't half-bad either, with each actor bringing their own unique flair to their roles, adding layers to the story. Especially Timothy Dalton is a treat, as he brings a certain charm and sophistication to his character that complements the film's overall tone.

The story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters show up during the film. This constant introduction of new faces adds to the complexity of the plot, requiring viewers to stay attentive to keep up. Things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things. This web of deceit and half-truths further entangles the narrative, creating a tapestry of intrigue and mystery. If you don't pay attention, things might get a bit messy in the end, but I really liked it. The film's ability to weave humor with such a convoluted storyline is part of what makes it so enjoyable.

Louis Morneau isn't all that well-known, but he has done a perfectly OK job with this one, and I never really grew impatient while watching the movie. His direction keeps the pacing just right, ensuring that the audience remains engaged throughout. The film's balance of humor and action is testament to Morneau's skill in crafting a story that entertains without becoming tedious or predictable.

Made Men is well worth checking out. It's a film that defies easy categorization, offering a blend of humor, intrigue, and excitement that keeps viewers on their toes. Whether you're a fan of action, comedy, or simply a good story, this movie has something to offer. The unexpected humor, combined with the engaging performances and intricate plot, make it a standout film that delivers more than it promises."

The movie ""Dragonfly"" being made in CQ has the problem of having no ending. This greatly parallels CQ, which also lacks an ending (in my opinion). The experience of watching CQ left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied, as if the film was missing a crucial element that would have tied everything together more cohesively. I found myself struggling to stay engaged with the narrative, which meandered without a clear direction or resolution. The parallels between the unfinished film within the film and CQ itself were hard to ignore, and they contributed to my overall sense of disappointment.

I was lucky enough to catch this movie at the SxSW film festival. I had fairly high expectations having just watched Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great movies. I was also looking forward to Jason Schwartzman's performance. But it was not an easy film to get into. The film festival environment often lends itself to unique and diverse cinematic experiences, and I had hoped CQ would be one of those standout films that left a lasting impression. However, my anticipation gradually turned into frustration as the film failed to deliver on its potential. The pacing was sluggish, and the storyline seemed to drift aimlessly, making it difficult for me to connect with the characters or the plot. If you're not into 60's sci-fi or slow movies that go nowhere, skip it.

CQ feels like a student film. If you want a recent sci-fi-esque indie film, rent Donnie Darko, it won't put you to sleep. Donnie Darko, with its intriguing plot and captivating atmosphere, offers a more engaging and thought-provoking experience for viewers who appreciate indie films with a sci-fi twist. In contrast, CQ's lack of focus and direction left me feeling underwhelmed, and I couldn't help but compare it unfavorably to other films in the genre that manage to strike a better balance between style and substance. If you're seeking a film that captivates your attention and leaves you pondering its themes long after the credits roll, Donnie Darko is a much more satisfying choice."

My main problem with this movie is that once Harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers -- with relative ease -- he continues to cave into their demands. This is something that really doesn't sit well with me, as it seems like a major flaw in the character's judgment. Considering the way Harry is portrayed throughout the film, one would expect him to take a more assertive approach in dealing with the situation. Instead, he allows himself to be manipulated by these individuals, which becomes increasingly frustrating to watch. And then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped, he decides to wire his classic car up to explode (with the money in it), which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic. This particular scene stretches the boundaries of believability, asking the audience to accept a course of action that seems almost too far-fetched. The decision to rig his beloved car with explosives, especially with the money inside, feels like a forced plot device rather than a natural progression of the story.

Okay, so he wanted to keep his affair with Cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the DA campaign. This I can see, as it provides a reasonable motivation for his initial compliance with the blackmailers. The stakes are undeniably high for Harry, given the potential fallout from his affair being exposed. However, why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit, or even kill them once he'd determined there was no actual blackmail evidence (e.g, Cini's body?) This question lingers throughout the latter part of the movie, as Harry's inaction seems incongruous with his character's established resourcefulness. The film hints at his capability and connections, yet he opts for a more passive approach instead of using his resources to confront the blackmailers head-on. This was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2/3 of it. The tension and intrigue built during the first two acts set up a promising narrative, keeping the audience engaged and invested in the storyline. However, after that, it sort of falls apart. The final act fails to deliver on the potential established earlier, leaving viewers with a sense of disappointment as the plot takes increasingly implausible turns, ultimately detracting from the overall impact of the film."

If this is successfully accomplished, the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay. After a few failed attempts, the creature is slain, but it's angry and vengeful mother soon attacks, leaving it up to Beowulf to, again, lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it.

After a few failed attempts, the creature is slain, but it's angry and vengeful mother soon attacks, leaving it up to Beowulf to, again, lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it. The plot seems to focus solely on these battles, neglecting the rich mythological and cultural context that surrounds the original story. The movie ""Grendel"" looks like it was shot on a tiny budget, and the CG effects are terrible, which detracts significantly from the viewing experience. The lack of high-quality effects makes it difficult for the audience to be immersed in the world that the filmmakers are trying to create. Like I said, this movie is absolutely needless. There are already numerous adaptations of the Beowulf legend, and this one fails to bring anything new or innovative to the table. Overall, it doesn't justify its existence in a crowded field of cinematic retellings of this classic story."

"I rented this one to see Vanesa Talor one more time. She can act, but doesn't get a chance in this clunker. The opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes.

Vanesa Talor's talent is undeniable, but unfortunately, this particular film does not provide her with the platform she needs to truly shine. The elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes in the opening sequence is quite deceiving, as it sets up expectations that the rest of the film fails to meet. It’s likely that this beautiful footage was sourced from a stock archive, because the rest of the movie is shot direct to videotape. This choice in production severely undermines the overall quality, making the production values pale in comparison to those of even lower-budget films like _Blair Witch_. 

The film’s attempt at special effects is laughable at best, with a particularly cheesy animated statue standing out as the most notable example. Unfortunately, there are no other effects worth mentioning. The movie is bad, but not in a way that provides any inadvertent amusement or entertainment value. It's a shame, as poor production choices overshadow any potential the film might have had.

"Anton Newcombe and Courtney Taylor are friends, they both are the leads in their own respective bands; Anton with The Brian Jonestown Massacre and Courtney with The Dandy Warhols. What's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals; its a love hate relationship. At times you both hear them praising one another, but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are. While the Dandy Warhols went on the reach commercial success, BJM still was stuck in the underground scene; and for good reason why.<br /><br />The focus of Dig! is more towards Anton and the BJM, as they have a lot more substance. They are the most dysfunctional band. During gigs they will fight and bash each other. Anton will hit other members if he feels they aren't performing correctly. With the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume, fight was always waiting to happen. You know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens; that's why people would go to their gigs, for the fights. <br /><br />Anton is very unstable. Always thinking himself as a music messiah, he wants to change music and create a revolution, but he could never get out of the underground. He is a very talented musician, its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill. But his draw back is he cant escape the world he created; a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs, alcohol and depression. On the other side, the Dandy Warhols were having their own troubles. They didn't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label. But they found huge success in Europe. But Courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of Anton. Its interesting that both Anton and Courtney both had what the other needed. Courtney always wanted to be musically talented as Anton, though Anton wouldn't say it, he needed the commercial success that the Dandy's had, to make his revolution.<br /><br />Over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands, there is a lot of footage. There is never a dull moment in Dig!. It is constantly moving along as it doesn't have time to slow down as it has to much to say, seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job. Ondi Timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more. Even if you don't like the bands it still deserves viewing; it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure.<br /><br />You wont be disappointed.",1,2544,True,21558,"Anton Newcombe and Courtney Taylor are friends and rivals, leading The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols, respectively. Their love-hate relationship is intriguing, with moments of praise followed by complaints about each other's flaws. While The Dandy Warhols achieved commercial success, BJM remained in the underground scene for good reason.

Dig! focuses more on Anton and BJM, highlighting their dysfunction. Their gigs were notorious for fights, fueled by drugs and alcohol, drawing audiences like spectators at a car crash. Anton is unstable, viewing himself as a music messiah aiming for revolution but unable to escape his self-created world of addiction and depression. Despite his talent, he's trapped. Meanwhile, Dandy Warhols struggled initially but found success in Europe. Courtney, though, was continually drawn back to Anton. Ironically, each possessed what the other needed: Courtney craved Anton's musical talent, and Anton needed the commercial success the Dandys enjoyed.

Over the seven years captured on film, Dig! is never dull. It moves briskly, compressing a lengthy story into a 1h 45min documentary. Ondi Timoner expertly pieces together a compelling narrative, making it a must-watch even if you're not a fan of the bands. It transcends the music, presenting a captivating story of a successful failure. You won't be disappointed."
"The movie 'Gung Ho!': The Story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders was made in 1943 with a view to go up the moral of American people at the duration of second world war. It shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda. The value of this film is only collection and no artistic. In a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors. Watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies or if you are a big fun of Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the film. If you want to see a film for the second world war, they exist much better and objective. I rated it 4/10.",0,647,False,9935,"""Gung Ho!"": The Story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders is a film that was made in 1943 with the primary intention of boosting the morale of the American people during the tumultuous period of the Second World War. This film serves as an excellent example of how cinema can be used as a tool for propaganda. The value of this film lies solely in its historical significance and its role as a piece of propaganda rather than any artistic merit it might possess. When evaluating a film that is primarily focused on propaganda, it is often futile to critique elements such as direction and acting, as these are not the central focus of the production. However, if you are interested in understanding how propaganda operates within the medium of film, or if you are an avid fan of Robert Mitchum, who appears in a minor role, this movie might be worth your time. For those who are looking to watch a film about the Second World War, there are many other films that offer a much better and more objective portrayal of the events. As for my personal rating, I would give it a 4/10."

Audio was quite bad, I had to raise it to about 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialog.

"What an atrocity. I am not one to demand total verisimilitude from a movie, but the plot and screenplay of ""Killing Zoe"" are so artless that I found myself wincing through the entire (mercifully short) ninety minutes of the film.<br /><br />Readers of these reviews will by now have figured out the plot: Zoe, a call girl who falls in love with American safecracker Zed, is also an employee at the bank that Zed will help rob in a high-stakes Bastille Day heist.<br /><br />The film strains one's credibility from the get-go. Zed and Zoe's night of magic is highly prosaic, and Zoe's claims to have experienced the orgasm of a lifetime would seem to reflect the screenwriter's lingering teenage fantasies more than any actual on-screen chemistry.

A secondary thread involves convincing us (by endless repetition) that Eric is really, REALLY glad to see his old friend Zed again. Really glad. Eric's devil-may-care, over-the-top flamboyance and affection for Zed isn't even remotely believable--check out, for example, his phony bemusement at discovering a dead cat in his apartment building. Development of the characters who will accompany us through the rest of the film is an afterthought.<br /><br />The heist is a disaster--understandable, since the plan is laughable and the criminals are complete amateurs. This is where Avary continues to pay tribute to his idol Quentin Tarantino by showing that he can be more violent than violent. In reality, though, he's just more boring than boring. To build up the excitement, there is an extra security guard hidden inside the main safe.

"You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film. Okay, I did actually choose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all slaps. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-pitched whine going on about how his politics are best, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment. He also finds time to slag off films that he doesn't like, something I thought was reserved for losers like me. Surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this. By making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his annoying voice. And when he started fawning over his newborn baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably not a self-obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music.

That's how I felt watching Aprile. I chose to see it, knowing Nanni Moretti's tendency to make himself the star, but after half an hour, I wanted to give him the madre of all slaps. Caro Diario was funny and unusual, with other characters getting a word in. In Aprile, Moretti hogs all the dialogue with his high-pitched whine about his politics and quirky popular culture interests. He even slags off films he doesn't like. Surely, he'd want to make a point about cinema more intelligently, maybe with a proper film that isn't dominated by his annoying voice. When he fawned over his newborn, I wanted normal company, not a self-obsessed director with a taste for tacky music. Next time someone tells you their life story, give them a slap from me. Every blow is a victory against Morettiism."
"After watching Stop-Loss, I find myself against disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stinker. Gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940's that made one proud to be an American, fighting the evilness that desires conquest abroad and death at home. What we are left with is dribble frothing at the mouth of rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young men who return home from the war. One descends into out-of-control madness, culminating in his death. The main protagonist deserts his country at a time of war, and destroys his best friends relationship with his fiancé at the same time. The third truly is the hero of the story, electing to continue the fight that was brought to our shores nearly eight years ago. What makes this movie bad, is not the acting, but the premise behind it. We are lead to believe that decorated soldiers are in fact haters of our country. Desertion is akin to treason in a time of war, and the main protagonist flirts with it throughout the movie. This paradox is designed to weaken the audience's reaction to the central act of the movie. We are not supposed to find fault with King, since he wears medals, but his actions don't just merit it, but cry out for it. He is not an anti-hero. In order to accept the movie, the audience must accept the correctness of desertion because the story paints King as nothing else short of a hero. I cannot accept that, since it is like asking me to call the sky yellow on a clear blue day. Furthermore, derision for the real hero is heaped upon, the man who re-enlists and continues to serve his country. I would only recommend this stinker to someone who needs convincing of the decay of Hollywood, as it is a clear example of it.

"Greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position.

Mrs. Hughes has specific requirements for her new secretary; she insists that Julia lives with her employer in her home and demands that she has no involvement with any men friends. Julia, having no family, assures Mrs. Hughes that she is free to devote her entire time to this job. The plot thickens as we are introduced to George Macready's character, Ralph Hughes, who is the son of Mrs. Hughes. Ralph has some very strange desires, particularly an unsettling fascination with playing around with knives, which adds to the suspense and intrigue of the film. Despite being a low-budget film, it cleverly utilizes most of the scenes as close-ups to avoid the expense of elaborate backgrounds and costs for scenery. This strange family resides in a huge mansion located off the Cornwall Coast of England, adding an element of isolation and mystery to the setting. The mansion is filled with secret doors, contributing to the film's atmosphere of suspense and intrigue, as Julia navigates through this eerie and enigmatic environment. The film's ability to build tension and maintain suspense throughout, combined with the strong performances of the cast, makes it a captivating watch for fans of the mystery thriller genre."
"Times are tough for Angel Town, gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown (Mainly due to embarrassing writing) the gangs want a street kid, Martine to join the gangs, so they beat him up everyday. However due to the presence of an Olympic kick-boxer (Olivier ""World's lamest actor"" Gruner) named Jacques, hope is on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made (And I've seen my share) it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need, are French kick-boxers who can't act. Worst of all there are so many awkward moments it's just truly hilarious. Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit: ""You like the fighting? (Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock) I could kill him right? When I want him dead he dies! The reason why I don't want him dead is because i'm afraid of him, and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me, that's why he doesn't die!"" <br /><br />Of course the fact that it's wrong to kill someone, let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation. Odd.<br /><br />However don't let me make this sound that I hated this movie, far from it, it's so terrible it's priceless. The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees Grunner going one on one with gang-members who (the film's biggest logic gap)decline the use of pistols. Also a handicapped Vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs, while Gruner kick-boxes the rest. All of this set to the sound of horrible ""Mexican"" accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this.<br /><br />The other treat about this movie, is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college despite that's the main reason he's here in the states and not in France getting it on with his girlfriend (In a graveyard in the film's awkward beginning) Angel Town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level, this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand make sure to down tequila, like the laughable opening song details ""Ain't no mercy in Angel Town"" <br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)",0,2349,True,12005,"Times are tough for Angel Town, where gangs rule and inexplicably target street kid Martine, beating him up daily.

"If you are studying Welles and want to see just how far he fell after Citizen Kane, this film will prove it.

The cheap excuse of making the protagonist a self-admitted dummy to explain how he might fall into such a half-baked scheme fails to explain the absurd courtroom theatrics and ridiculous plot twists that eventually ensue. It is quite disappointing to witness how a filmmaker of Welles' caliber could be associated with such a film, especially after the masterpiece that was Citizen Kane. The narrative lacks coherence, and the characters, despite their potential, feel underdeveloped and unconvincing. Don't be taken in by the high rating of this film in the db as I was; all I can guess is that there are a lot of die hard old Welles and Hayworth fans out there. The film seems to rely heavily on the star power of its leads, rather than focusing on delivering a compelling story. This reliance on star appeal, rather than substantial content, might explain why some viewers hold it in higher regard than it deserves. It is perplexing how the film has managed to garner such a high rating, and it raises questions about the criteria and standards by which it is judged. Nevertheless, for anyone interested in the trajectory of Welles' career, this film serves as a stark reminder of the challenges and missteps that can occur even for the most talented filmmakers."

However, A Little Less Conversation - rollnecks and 60s grooving aside - is a real standout. Finding a lesser-known song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions.

"Quai des Orfevres takes too long getting going, with Clouzot so enamored of his back-stage milieu that he is almost in danger of forgetting the story. However, once it does, it's Clouzot at his best. Bertrand Blier (father of Bertrand Blier and co-star of his Buffet Froid) is the worldworn pianist who married beneath himself and who plans to kill the seedy studio mogul with designs on his wife only to find that someone has beaten him to it. Not only that, but his carefully planned but clumsily executed alibi falls to pieces, not least when a thief steals his car at the murder scene<br /><br />The film really kicks into life with the arrival of Luis Jouvet's police inspector, a rather wonderful creation half Alistair Sim in Green for Danger and half world-weary Maigret with better dialog. In a neat running gag, his investigation is constantly conducted at the top of his voice against chaos and noise, whether it be the noisy typewriters of the police station or a loud rehearsal.

However, once it does, it's Clouzot at his best. Bertrand Blier (father of Bertrand Blier and co-star of his Buffet Froid) is the worldworn pianist who married beneath himself and who plans to kill the seedy studio mogul with designs on his wife only to find that someone has beaten him to it. His carefully planned but clumsily executed alibi falls to pieces, not least when a thief steals his car at the murder scene

The film kicks into life with the arrival of Luis Jouvet's police inspector, a wonderful creation half Alistair Sim in Green for Danger and half world-weary Maigret with better dialog. In a neat running gag, his investigation is constantly conducted at the top of his voice against chaos and noise. The police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation, with chaotic and telling small details that makes Steve Bocchco's once revolutionary 80's US cop shows look like antiquated museum pieces by comparison.

"OK this will contain spoilers. Now I have never seen such a large pile of poop since the laxative/feed mix up at the elephant enclosure in the zoo! It has more plot holes than moth eaten lace and as for the 'realistic' plot line. Well sexual slavery is a dreadful and very real world wide problem and this pile of bilge utilises this plague as a plot device to titillate and tease, shame on everyone involved for that piece of questionable judgement. But back to the film, if you were going to kidnap people from an airport, some of the most secure and camera happy places in the modern world by the way, then why plant a stoolie on the inside of the van who does bugger all until the plot needs a twist. Just wait until you are out of the airport, pull the gun, handcuff the passengers, drive calmly to the warehouse and kill the guys, job done. On the passengers side, on at least three occasions the good guys have the bad guys incapacitated and are armed, WASTE THEM! Once in a movie it can just be acceptable not to put a bullet in the bad guys skull, but COME ON three times! And after he's killed most of you. Also the guy is willing to put down the gun to stop a scarred cheek but kills a girl for a yeast infection that could be cleared up with $20 dollars worth of drugs. I could go on and on about the amount of holes in this but I won't waste any more of my time. Suffice to say that I have rarely been so insulted by such a dreadful piece of drivel and as for the real problem of sexual slavery, girls go voluntarily to new 'jobs' in distant lands and are abused, raped, and often killed by the gang master who meets them off the boat/plane and takes their passports and freedom. This s**t is an insult to anyone whose life has been affected by this! Do not waste your time!",0,1787,True,29917,"Sure, here's a shorter version of the review:

This film is a massive disappointment, with more plot holes than a moth-eaten lace. It exploits the serious issue of sexual slavery for titillation, which is in poor taste. The plot is unrealistic, with absurd scenarios like kidnapping from an airport—one of the most secure places. The insider in the van does nothing until a convenient twist, and the good guys repeatedly fail to eliminate the bad guys when they have the chance. The villain's inconsistent behavior is baffling. Overall, this film is an insult to those affected by sexual slavery. Don’t waste your time!"
"RKO was trying to boost its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed enough to make a doctor (JOHN BEAL) come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer. TCM aired it as a stepping-stone in the career of Joan Fontaine.<br /><br />Fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is okay as her love interest. But it's obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young James Garner) is the actor who should have shared top billing with Fontaine. Whatever happened to this handsome actor? Why didn't RKO promote him, along with Fontaine? He showed skill as a light comedian.<br /><br />These are the kind of thoughts that went through my head as I watched this rather tepid drama which never quite lives up to the stark promise of its title. The story itself is rather tiresome, only occasionally coming to life because of Fontaine's spirited heroine.<br /><br />She photographs prettily as the nurse and wears her serious expressions skillfully, suggesting that there was more to be tapped at a future date. Beal never did go on to a distinguished career and his performance here shows why. Strictly lackluster.<br /><br />But whatever happened to Philip Huston?

The film captures the essence of horse racing with such authenticity and detail that it draws you into the world of the sport with ease. The characters are well-developed, and the plot unfolds in a way that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Walter Matthau's performance is truly a standout, reminding us of his incredible talent and charisma that made him a beloved figure in the film industry. The movie not only highlights the challenges faced by the characters but also showcases the triumphs and joys that come with perseverance and dedication.

As you watch the story unfold, you'll find yourself rooting for the underdogs, cheering them on as they overcome obstacles and strive for success. It's a heartwarming tale that resonates with audiences of all ages, making it a perfect choice for family movie night. The racing scenes are particularly well-executed, offering a thrilling glimpse into the fast-paced world of quarter horse racing. The attention to detail in the depiction of racing terms and equipment adds an extra layer of authenticity to the film, making it a must-watch for horse racing enthusiasts.

Overall, this movie is a celebration of determination, hope, and the unbreakable bond between humans and horses.

It could have been a good movie if only the plot had matched the caliber of the actors involved. Unfortunately, the plot was atrocious. It was completely predictable, trite, and boring, leaving much to be desired in terms of storytelling and creativity.

From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie was laid out like a child's paint-by-numbers routine, lacking any form of suspense or intrigue that might have kept the audience engaged. The characters were stock pieces of cut-out cardboard, offering nothing more than clichéd portrayals that failed to resonate on any meaningful level. There was nothing new or interesting to say, and that completely outweighed the acting, which was a pity because the performances deserved a more compelling narrative to complement them.

Finally, too bad the scriptwriter wasn't the victim. Especially with the ""precocious"" lines from the child, which were completely unbelievable and detracted from the overall believability of the film. The attempt to inject humor or wit fell flat, as these lines seemed forced and out of place, breaking the immersion for viewers who were already struggling to find something of substance in the plot.

Again, it's only the acting that prevented a much lower score. The actors brought a level of professionalism and commitment that was evident in every scene, but unfortunately, their efforts were not enough to salvage a script that simply did not do justice to their skills. It's disappointing when a film with such potential falters due to a lackluster storyline, but at the very least, the performances provided a glimmer of what could have been, had the writing been up to par."

Nope, this thing is 72 minutes, tops. It certainly doesn't extend beyond that duration, and if it claims to be longer, it's quite misleading. The pacing, the plot, and every aspect of this film make it evident that it's a concise 72 minutes. 

If you cannot guess the killer in this movie, you had better throw your TV out the window, because you ain't learned nothing in 20+ years of cinematic slasher history. The clues are glaringly obvious, and anyone with a smidgen of experience in watching slasher films should have no trouble identifying the culprit. It's almost as if the filmmakers intended for the audience to solve the mystery well before the characters do. 

And how come the plain star who never gets naked is always the one you want to get naked? It's a curious phenomenon that seems to recur in films of this genre. The character who exudes a certain charm or allure, yet remains modestly clad throughout the movie, often captures the audience's imagination. This unfulfilled expectation adds a layer of intrigue and leaves viewers contemplating what might have been."

The setup is intriguing enough to capture any viewer's attention, promising a tangled web of mystery and suspense that you would expect from a high-caliber thriller. Yet, as the film runs along, your disappointment increases inevitably. Scene after scene, the narrative fails to build on the initial promise, and the tension that should have been woven throughout the plot simply dissipates. The pacing feels sluggish, and the characters seem to drift through the storyline without any real purpose or urgency, leaving the audience yearning for more substance or twists that never materialize.

""Ordeal by Innocence"" is a dull and at times even boring film that doesn't raise at any moment. The film trudges through its runtime without offering any moments of genuine intrigue or excitement. The plot, which could have been a complex exploration of guilt and innocence, instead unfolds in a predictable and uninspired manner. The characters lack depth, and their interactions do little to ignite interest or empathy from the audience. Nothing interesting happens all along, and even the final revealing of the facts lacks surprise and intensity (whether you guessed or not). The climax, which should have been a revelation that ties together the film's threads with a shocking or thought-provoking conclusion, instead falls flat and feels anticlimactic. It seems almost perfunctory, as if the film is merely going through the motions without any real investment in delivering a satisfying resolution.

Donald Sutherland, Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, and Sarah Miles (far from her good performance in ""Ryan's Daughter"") just pass through their roles and not very enthusiastically either. Despite the presence of such a talented cast, their performances feel lackluster and uninspired, as though they are merely coasting through their parts without fully inhabiting their characters. This lack of enthusiasm is palpable and further detracts from any potential engagement with the film. The script offers them little to work with, and their talents are underutilized in roles that fail to challenge or showcase their abilities.

You won't miss much if you skip this one. Indeed, the film leaves little impact and is easily forgettable, offering no compelling reason to invest your time or attention. It lacks the essential elements of a gripping thriller and leaves the audience with a sense of unfulfilled potential. In summary, ""Ordeal by Innocence"" is an underwhelming film that fails to deliver on its initial promise, making it a largely forgettable experience."

"Extremely dull drama starring a very young Roddy McDowall, who trains a wild horse, the Flicka of the title, and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place.

The naffly-titled sequel, 'Thunderhead, Son of Flicka', in which McDowall trains the next generation of nag, is marginally better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to pummel you into submission, although there are at least one or two scenes that don't induce a coma.",0,643,False,7530,"The film in question is an extremely dull drama that features a very young Roddy McDowall, who takes on the task of training a wild horse, the Flicka of the title. McDowall's performance is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place, as the rest of the film struggles to hold any real interest. The movie is coated in blaring, overbearing music that seems to overshadow everything else, and it is weighed down by schmaltzy dialogue that fails to resonate or engage. This is one of those interminable films that bores you to the point of a gnawing headache, leaving you wondering if it will ever end.

The movie drags on with a sluggish pace, never really picking up momentum or delivering any compelling scenes that capture the viewer's attention. The soundtrack, which could have added an emotional layer to the story, instead becomes a relentless assault on the ears, leaving you wishing for some moments of silence. The dialogue, meant to convey the heartfelt bond between McDowall's character and the horse, comes across as overly sentimental and cliché, never quite hitting the mark.

The naffly-titled sequel, 'Thunderhead, Son of Flicka', attempts to continue the story, with McDowall now training the next generation of nag. This follow-up is marginally better than the original, but it still suffers from many of the same issues that plagued its predecessor. The pace remains slow, and the score continues to pummel you into submission, making it difficult to fully invest in the story. However, there are at least one or two scenes in the sequel that don't induce a coma, providing brief moments of respite from the otherwise monotonous experience.

Overall, while 'Thunderhead, Son of Flicka' offers a slight improvement over the original, both films ultimately fail to deliver a compelling narrative or memorable characters. McDowall's performance stands out as a highlight, but it is not enough to save either film from being an arduous viewing experience. The combination of overbearing music, schmaltzy dialogue, and a lack of engaging storytelling makes these films a challenge to sit through, leaving you with little more than a gnawing headache and a sense of relief when the credits finally roll."

The film is indeed one that will appeal to the entire family, not just attention-addled youngsters. It even managed to land five Oscar nominations, hardly a sign of slacking off for a general audience.<br /><br />Anne Revere, in the part of Velvet's mother, actually won an Oscar for her performance. She was indeed excellent in the role but it is 12-year old Elizabeth Taylor who steals the show. She is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. Also on board are Oscar-winner Donald Crisp as Velvet's father, Mickey Rooney as former jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury (in one of her earliest film roles) as Velvet's older sister.<br /><br />The film's lustrous Technicolor makes for an attractive viewing experience while the editing secured the second of the film's two Oscars. Additionally, the film was nominated for its direction (by Clarence Brown), cinematography & art direction. The score by ten-time Oscar nominee Herbert Stothart is also worth mentioning, though it went unnominated.<br /><br />All in all, ""National Velvet"" is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating. I realize that the prospect of watching a film about a girl and her horse isn't exactly going to thrill some people but this one is worth taking a chance on.",1,1689,True,44394,"""National Velvet"" tells the story of Velvet Brown, a young English girl who dreams of entering her beloved horse into the prestigious Grand National horse race.

"The Kindred opens to shots of a Porsche racing along a highway, it catches up with an old pick-up truck and gets held up. As it speeds past the pick-up the driver (Benjamin J.Perry as Ben Perry) shouts obscenities and honks his horn. Distracted he doesn't notice an obstruction ahead and crashes his Porsche. He is quickly freed from the wreckage and is taken to hospital. On the way the Paramedic (Randy Harrington) trying to save him suggests that he probably won't make it. Then the Ambulance is attacked and forced off the road by a van. The driver of the van, Jackson (Jim Boeke as James F.Boeke) beats the Paramedic up and steals the patient. The Ambulance driver, Harry (Charles Grueber) makes no attempt to stop him. Once the injured man has been placed into the van Jackson turns his attention to Harry whom seem to know each other. Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw 'last time'. Jackson punches Harry to the floor and throws a bundle of money at him. The film then makes it perfectly clear we are in San Fransisco by showing a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sharon Raymond is woken up by a phone call for her boyfriend Dr. John Hollins (David Allen Brooks) to inform him that his Mother, Amanda (Kim Hunter) who has recently had a heart attack has regained consciousness. Hollins works for a company called the 'Geneticell Corporation' and is delighted at the news and heads off to see her. Once there she asks him to go back to his old childhood house in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all of her notes and experiments, especially the 'Anthony journals' which Hollins has never heard of, she also claims that he has a brother named Anthony. Back at Geneticell, Hollins talks with a Dr. Phillip Lloyd (Rod Steiger) about his Mother as they had both worked together before they had a falling out with each other, and questions him about her research and if he knows of anyone called Anthony. He claims he knows nothing. When Amanda dies after a visit from the sinister Dr. Lloyd, Hollins decides to carry out his Mothers request and try to find out who Anthony is. While paying his final respects at the funeral a woman named Melissa Leftridge (Amanda Pays) introduces herself to Hollins and says she was a big admirer of his Mothers work and research after she helped her. Because Melissa seems to know so much about his Mothers work he invites her to the house as she may possibly be able to help find some answers to various questions he has. Hollins, Sharon, Melissa and three lab assistants, Brad Baxter (Peter Frechette), Hart Phillips (Timothy Gibbs) and Cindy Russell (Julia Montgomery) plus a girl with a watermelon(!) named Nell Valentine (Bunki Z, great name what were her parents thinking!?). They get down to business straight away but find little of any interest. For some reason no one at this point thinks to look in the basement, which is just as well as there's something down there, something large, slimy and has lots of tentacles. First it kills Duke, the dog. Then it moves on to larger prey. When Hart is attacked by something in a barn Hollins decides he must destroy all traces of his Mothers work and whatever Anthony is. Jointly co-written and directed by Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow, Carpenter also acted as cinematographer and Obrow as producer. This is a pretty poor film in my opinion. The script is credited to five(!) writers, Carpenter, Obrow, Earl Ghaffari, John Penny and Joseph Stefano and with five people working on it I'd like to think they could come up with something a little bit better and more coherent than this. Nothing is explained that well, why did Amanda create these monstrous sea creature/human hybrids? What is Dr. Lloyd's interest and his motives? Why does he steal bodies from the back of Ambulance's? Why does he have a basement full of mutants? Why do none of these so-called genetic scientists think to check the basement out? Could Melissa act more suspiciously even if she tried? Why are none of the characters given any background? Why do people keep mentioning a substance found in sea creatures called Hemocynine when 99.9% of the audience isn't going to have clue what their on about? There is also a serious lack of blood and gore, only one person dies on screen, just one! And all the scientists survive in a vomit inducingly mushy 'happy ending'. This is a horror film guys, all we want to see is the slimy monsters kill and eat people in various gory ways. The one on screen death is actually quite cool, someone has slimy tentacles inserted under their skin, in their ear and up their nose in the films only decent horror sequence. To try and up the gore quotent there is a scene where Dr. Lloyd is experimenting on a skinned animal but it only lasts for a few seconds, and in the context of the rest of the film doesn't mean a thing. Melissa also turns into a fish, don't ask. There's no nudity either, which isn't a surprise. The film looks professional enough with decent production values but is just so dull and plods along at a snails pace, we don't even get to see the giant monster in the basement until 15 odd minutes before the end which is far too little far too late, when it does make an appearance the effects are OK and that makes it even more of a shame that it wasn't used more. Overall I was very disappointed and I was expecting a lot better. A horror film with only one on screen death and only three in total, what's the world coming too?",0,5486,True,32948,"The Kindred opens with a Porsche racing along a highway, quickly catching up to and passing an old pick-up truck.

The narrative doesn't hold up, and the characters lack depth, making it difficult to care about their fates. You find yourself questioning how this film even got made in the first place. The plot holes and inconsistencies are glaring, and they detract from any potential enjoyment one might derive. It's a film that struggles to maintain coherence and fails to deliver any memorable moments. The horror elements are lackluster at best, and the attempt at suspense falls flat. In essence, ""Miner's Massacre"" is a film best left unwatched, unless you enjoy movies that test your patience and endurance. The experience is akin to watching paint dry, leaving you wondering if perhaps the mundane task of cleaning could offer more excitement and satisfaction."

"I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films. It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully. It has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it. It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate.

"Effort aside (This isn't a review about good intentions, its about the final product), this film is poorly written, overacted, and poorly directed. The story obviously had potential, but that story is nowhere present in this film.<br /><br />Clara Barton was a human being. She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness, and self doubt just like the rest of us. You would never know that from this film of the lead actress's performance. In fact apply that to every character in the film, but in Barton's case: Every sentence is a speech. An epic over the top speech as though from an inhuman robot. In fact the only scene that plays well in one in the board meeting, and I realized thats because she's making a speech! Every idea she has is unbelievable in its context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of soul searching right on the spot.

It robs her of her humanity, and it inherently cheapens all she did because the script is written in clichés.

"Aim For The Top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it. I totally loved this series, and to this day, it remains my favorite anime. And while it was not Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series.<br /><br />Mainly starting out as a parody of the 1970's sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2, when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive the death of her father, who was killed in mankind's initial encounter with the insect race Humanity is at war with. It is because of her father's death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko's coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. And he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot, for he was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was killed.<br /><br />Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first sortie together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood friend. Kimiko's involvement is also of interest, as while Noriko is off in space, Kimiko remains behind on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the acts of time dilation, Kimiko ages normally on Earth while Noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school. By the end of the series, Noriko is roughly 18 years old while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Anno's other shows, or are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork, then give this show a chance. It will grow on you.",1,1936,True,23679,"Aim For The Top!

It's not just about the romance or the comedy, but also about the love for baseball and how it can bring people together. The chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon is delightful and adds to the charm of the movie. The backdrop of Boston and the Red Sox provides a vibrant setting that sports fans will appreciate. It's fascinating how the film captures the essence of being a sports fan and the lengths to which they go to support their team. The humor is light-hearted and the storyline is engaging enough to keep the viewers entertained throughout.

My sports-hating wife, my teenage daughter, and I all found something to like in the film. That says something in itself.

It's a movie that can bring together people with varying tastes and preferences, making it a versatile choice for a family movie night or a casual watch with friends. The balance between romance and sports is well-maintained, ensuring that it does not lean too heavily towards one aspect. This balance is what makes ""Fever Pitch"" a standout film in its genre. The storyline is predictable yet satisfying, providing a comforting sense of familiarity to the audience. It's a testament to the filmmakers' ability to create a film that resonates with a wide range of viewers, regardless of their usual genre preferences.

May Goldthwaits' hands be rendered paralyzed so he cannot write another script. Strike his tongue so he cannot dictate another unfunny scene. He is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into Hollywood. 

This movie, from start to finish, is a testament to how far Goldthwait has fallen. His lack of humor is evident in every poorly written scene, and his inability to create characters that resonate or evoke any sense of compassion is glaring. The female lead, much like the rest of the film, is devoid of any qualities that make a character interesting or relatable. It's as if Goldthwait deliberately went out of his way to craft a film that is both unfunny and unenjoyable, leaving viewers to wonder how such a project was ever greenlit in the first place. The opening line alone sets the tone for the rest of the movie, a tone that is as flat and uninspired as Goldthwait's comedic sensibilities have become. 

One can't help but feel that Goldthwait's need to degrade stems from deep-seated issues, ones that he projects onto his work, resulting in a film that feels more like an exercise in self-loathing than a genuine attempt at comedy. Shakes the Clown was a clear indicator of his comedic decline, but this latest effort is an even more egregious example of his inability to craft anything of substance or humor. The film lacks any accidental moments of comedy, moments that might have salvaged some semblance of entertainment value. Instead, it is a dreary, uninspired mess that leaves audiences feeling more depressed than amused. 

Goldthwait's continued presence in Hollywood is perplexing, given his apparent disdain for the craft and his inability to produce anything worthwhile. His hands, the tools of his trade, have become instruments of cinematic torture, churning out scripts that are both painful to watch and devoid of any redeeming qualities. His tongue, once capable of delivering biting comedic lines, now only serves to spew uninspired drivel that fails to connect with audiences on any level. It's a sad state of affairs, and one can only hope that he steps aside to allow for fresh, new talent to emerge in Hollywood, talent that can bring back the laughter and joy that Goldthwait's work sorely lacks."

I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis, a sentiment that is both relatable and heart-wrenching. The kid is tough, displaying a resilience and courage that is inspiring, and the performance by Jonathan Furr is superb, bringing a raw honesty to the character. His portrayal captures the innocence and determination of youth in a way that is both convincing and moving. Equally impressive is the veteran performance by Ron Perlman, who brings a seasoned gravitas to his role, adding layers of complexity to the film's emotional landscape. His presence is commanding, yet understated, allowing the story to unfold with a natural grace and authenticity that elevates the entire film."

"Cuore Sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired. With a script that the screen-writers for ""Touched by an Angel"" might have passed up as being too impuissant, Ozpetek still keeps us interested at times. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positives but I found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that I think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones.<br /><br />This movie is at heart (pun intended) a story built on a big twist-style ending. This kind of tenuous foundation can result in a tremendous success like Tornatore's Una Pura Formalità or god-awful garbage like the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Cuore Sacro falls somewhat closer to the latter. I found the cinematography in general to be above average. The tracking shots of Irene dutifully doing her quotidian laps in the pool were very impressive as was the atmosphere conjured by the interior of her mother's house. For me, the grotesque parody of Michelangelo's Pieta when Giancarlo comes in from the rain and Irene poses with him was a bit of a stretch. One big issue that I took exception to in this film was Ozpetek's method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions taking place. This worked to fantastic effect in Facing Windows, but when employed here it seems that Bubolova is no Mezzogiorno. In fact besides the ridiculous story, the main problem with this film is the milquetoast performance of it's main character. It made the final breakdown scene even more unconscionably bad. <br /><br />In this movie Ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporate-driven societies by urging us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and more altruistic. And while I'm certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view, I felt as if the audience was being hit over the head with a blunt object. Could the characters have been anymore two-dimensional? I tended to find this movie very enervating and soulless. Was the ""evil"" aunt Eleonora anything more than a caricature? It goes for the people on the side of ""right"" too, like the ""good"" aunt Maria Clara and the elderly doorman Aurelio. And just in case we might have missed Ozpetek's point, he decided to clothe his opposing forces in their own liveries. <br /><br />This brings me to an interesting point about the director's use of color. He clothes the opening couple who briefly take flight in all black, as well as Irene (when we first meet her and after her life-conversion), the evil aunt Eleonora, and of course the good but confused Padre Carras. Black is a color that suggests a definite course, the wearer's mind is set and emotionless. It is the color of choice for that indispensable item of modern day armor, the business suit. It is also the color of mourning, such as the funerary finery sported by the suicidal duo. Finally, black is the color of piety, such as the simple robes of priests and nuns that Irene emulates in the second half of the film. <br /><br />The other main color, and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart, is red. It is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component. The character who wears red is bold, emotional, receptive to new ideas, and indulgent. Red is a risky color in modern times; it challenges our perceptions of the wearer and at the same time makes the wearer vulnerable. Yet red carries an enormous weight of history and mysticism, as the earliest members of Cro-Magnon man buried their dead in red ochre and indeed the first man named in the Torah, Adam, is named after the Hebrew word for red. Red also has an anachronistic flavor, looking back on the past where red (and by association a less self-driven attitude towards life) was more accepted. So when we encounter the red-filled room (the mysterious frieze covered walls complete with a red accented menorah and a red painting of a Whirling Dervish!) of Irene's mother, ""good"" characters Maria Clara and Aurelio wearing resplendent outfits of red, and finally the painting of Irene's mother in a formal red gown we can see where Ozpetek's sympathies lie.<br /><br />A word or two about the soundtrack, I found the original musical themes to be excellently suited to the story.

One absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria we hear as the power is flickering while Irene is chasing Benny through the house. It is of the famous aria ""Ebben? ... Ne andrò lontano"" from Catalani's opera ""La Wally"". The aria is sung by the lead soprano who is leaving home forever. As Irene's mother was a dramatic soprano, we can guess that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a poignant farewell to her daughter, as in the movie Irene is soon destined to never again see Benny alive.

The film truly captivates the audience with its unique blend of humor and charm, making it a standout piece that is hard to forget. Outstandingly funny scenes include an hilarious shoot (and re-shoot) of a WW1 trench scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as an optimistic non-com and the hapless McDoakes as a Boyer/Colman messenger — all under the beady eye of Ralph Sanford's delightfully irascible Anguish. The interplay of the characters in these scenes brings about a kind of comedic magic that is rare to find, showcasing the talents of the actors involved. A lost McDoakes guided and re-guided by equally perplexed Jack Carson adds another layer of comedy, displaying a wonderful chemistry between the actors that keeps the audience thoroughly entertained. Assistant director Chandler rejoicing in a McDoakes-sent opportunity: ""I'm going to be a director!"" adds to the film’s charm, providing an additional humorous twist to the storyline. 

Ace comic O'Hanlon has a dual role, playing both McDoakes and himself playing McDoakes! This clever casting choice adds depth and an intriguing level of complexity to the film, making it even more engaging for viewers. Oddly, Richard L. Bare who does play himself in one or more other entries in the series, has turned down that opportunity here. It’s an interesting decision that adds an element of mystery to the production, sparking curiosity among fans. In real life, Bare's a youngish, six-foot Rock Hudson lookalike, but here he's impersonated by veteran actor (over 500 movies!), Jack Mower. This substitution is both surprising and delightful, bringing a unique flavor to the film that is sure to be appreciated by audiences. The film, with its exceptional cast and captivating storyline, truly stands out as a remarkable piece of cinema, fully deserving of its prestigious Hollywood award nomination."
"This production has absolutely no storyline. The acting is embarrassing. The promising Dutch television Sophie Hilbrand star should not add this movie to her CV.

Do not bother to watch this movie: it is a complete waste of time, a waste of money, and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand. She has previously proved to be much better with her clothes on when appearing on the screen. This movie fails on multiple levels, and it's unfortunate to see someone with such potential be associated with this kind of project. The lack of a coherent storyline makes it difficult to engage with the film on any meaningful level, and the attempts at drama or humor fall flat due to poor execution. The overemphasis on explicit content seems to serve no purpose other than to shock, rather than contribute anything of substance to the narrative. It's disappointing to see the Netherlands depicted in such a clichéd and negative manner, which does a disservice to the country's rich culture and vibrant communities. In conclusion, this movie is not worth your time or money, and it stands as a regrettable entry in Sophie Hilbrand's otherwise promising career."
"I really enjoyed watching this movie about the Delany sisters. I knew of them, but that was all. This movie opened my eyes to their bravado and courage. What a pair.

They came from a very loving and very strict family with high, maybe even impossible standards of perfection.

"If vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this Goth-fest based on the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience.

What he finds is a world filled with new sounds, a new kind of music-- driving and penetrating-- sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome. And he knows that at long last his time has come, that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms. Toward that end he becomes the front man for a band-- a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known. He presents himself as a vampire, and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond London (where it all begins), and will ultimately take him to Death Valley, California, where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced.<br /><br />	Lestat is powerful, without question, but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them, one of whom is Marius (Vincent Perez), a vampire powerful in his own right-- the vampire, in fact, who `made' Lestat so many years before-- and they are gathering, coming together and making their plans to meet Lestat at the concert. And they are not going for the music. But there is something else, as well: At one point Lestat has inadvertently awakened the `Mother' of them all, the most powerful of all the vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who is about to make her presence known to all, and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her King: Lestat. And at the concert, rest assured, Akasha will be in attendance, without fail.<br /><br />	Make no mistake, this is Lestat's story, and Rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments, though his film has less bite to it than say, `Interview With the Vampire,' or `Bram Stoker's Dracula.' He sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills, but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be, or as much as one might expect. In the final tally, in fact, the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual blood-letting, though there is more than a taste of gore, and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff. There's some good F/X on hand, too, especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires, as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern. It's a decent job by Rymer, but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by Lestat; as it is, you get a sense of his detachment, but not enough to get you totally involved.<br /><br />	In `Interview With the Vampire,' Tom Cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of Lestat, but Townsend is even more effective, with a look and an attitude that captures Lestat perfectly.

Another one of my favorite episodes is where Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) get locked in a gas station on Michelle's birthday. The premise of this episode was both hilarious and touching at the same time. You'd also have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how and why that happened. The comedic timing and the way the situation was handled added a unique touch to the episode's storyline. I have many other ones that I like, too, each bringing its own special moments and life lessons. Everyone always gave a good performance, bringing their characters to life in a way that was relatable and endearing. The production design was spectacular, capturing the essence of a warm, loving home. The costumes were well-designed, reflecting the personalities of the characters and the era in which the show was set. The writing was always very strong, with scripts that were both entertaining and meaningful. In conclusion, even though it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good. The show continues to be a beloved classic that has left a lasting impact on its viewers, and it's definitely worth watching if you haven't already."

"I've always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's versions of the Shakespeare classics, as he always does a very good job, but in this movie, the one who lifts the whole movie, is none other than ""the-always-great-actor"" Laurence Fishburne. Surely he has made some poor choices in films, even though he's a wonderful actor, but in this one we're truly given the real Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with Fishburne's well portrayed paranoia and, furthermore, we're finally given a black Othello!<br /><br />I don't think they could have chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him that blend of sympathy/antipathy, love/hatred and, not to forget, those fiery eyes...?

His adaptations are a treat for anyone who appreciates Shakespearean drama, and they never fail to capture the essence of the plays. But in this movie, the one who lifts the whole movie, is none other than ""the-always-great-actor"" Laurence Fishburne. Surely he has made some poor choices in films, even though he's a wonderful actor, capable of delivering powerful performances across a range of genres, but in this one we're truly given the real Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with Fishburne's well portrayed paranoia and, furthermore, we're finally given a black Othello! This is significant, as it adds an important layer of authenticity and relevance to the portrayal of the character, staying true to Shakespeare's original depiction while resonating with contemporary audiences.

I don't think they could have chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him that blend of sympathy/antipathy, love/hatred and, not to forget, those fiery eyes that seem to burn with the intensity of Othello's internal struggles...? Branagh is good as always, maintaining his usual standard of excellence, but not at his peak, Iréne Jacob's Desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak, bringing a subtle grace to her role that, while commendable, doesn't quite match the vibrancy of Fishburne's portrayal, whilst Laurence Fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. His presence on screen is magnetic, drawing viewers into Othello's world and making them feel every moment of his tragic journey. Do watch it, as it is a film that offers a rich and compelling experience, showcasing the talents of its cast and the enduring power of Shakespeare's storytelling."
"Six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing. Now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and getting revenge for her murder.<br /><br />Yea, basically that's the short of it. There's more to it than that, but I still have no clue what it is. The only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun, as I was pretty impressed for being a more low-budget flick. I'm also confused as to whether or not it's in English. Most of the actors are Italian, and even the title here is in Italian, yet they spoke English in the film (I think, or it might've been dubbed, I still can't tell).<br /><br />Anyway, the real premise of the film is pretty idiotic, and the ending not only doesn't make sense, it...well...doesn't make sense.",0,772,False,33451,"Six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing. Now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and getting revenge for her murder. This is the basic premise of the film, and while it sounds intriguing at first glance, there's a lot more to it than just this. However, despite this additional depth, I still have no clue what it is. The narrative seems to be shrouded in mystery, leaving the viewer scratching their head as they try to piece together the story. 

One of the standout elements, though, is the special effects used for the spiritual nun. I must say, I was pretty impressed with how they managed to pull it off, especially considering it appears to be a more low-budget flick. The effects really added a layer of eeriness and suspense that was quite effective, making it one of the more memorable aspects of the film. 

Another point of confusion for me was the language. I'm still not entirely sure whether the film is in English. Most of the actors are Italian, and even the title here is presented in Italian, yet they spoke English in the film, at least I think they did. It might have been dubbed, but I still can't tell for sure. This added another layer of complexity, as it was a bit jarring trying to follow the dialogue while being uncertain about the language.

Anyway, the real premise of the film, when you get down to it, is pretty idiotic. The plot stretches the bounds of believability, and the ending not only doesn't make sense, it...well...doesn't make sense. It's as if the film builds up to a climax that it can't quite deliver on, leaving viewers bewildered rather than satisfied. Despite the intriguing setup and impressive effects, the film struggles to tie everything together in a coherent way, resulting in an experience that is more confusing than captivating."
"Cooley High is considered one of my best all time movies. It certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago during the early, mid, and late 1960's.

The characters, the setting, and the storyline all come together to create a cinematic experience that is both nostalgic and timeless. The friendships and the adventures portrayed in the movie are reminiscent of the fun and carefree days of my own youth. It truly is a masterpiece that stands the test of time.

Whatever happened to Brenda and Pooter? Someone needs to track those two down. Brenda, with her beauty and grace, was a standout character, and Pooter, with his innocent wit and charm, added so much depth and humor to the story.

I think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun-filled movie.

I certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of MOVIE HALL OF FAME. It is a film that has touched the hearts of many and continues to do so with each new generation of viewers. The authenticity and relatability of Cooley High make it a strong contender for such an honor. All of the cast of this movie was great. Each actor brought something unique and special to their role, contributing to the overall magic of the film. My opinion of ""Cooley High"" is to turn back the hands of time; those were the fun years. The memories it evokes and the emotions it stirs are priceless, and it will always hold a special place in my heart as one of the greatest films of all time."

This was a silly movie with a predictable storyline and dreadful acting!! Willy Nelson was as stiff as his braids.

The storyline lacked depth and originality, making it difficult to engage with on any meaningful level. It simply felt like a series of clichés strung together without any real effort to create something unique or entertaining. The acting was consistently flat, failing to bring any of the characters to life in a way that was remotely convincing or relatable. Overall, this film was a huge disappointment in every aspect, from the narrative to the performances, and it ultimately left a lot to be desired."

The plot is disconnected and, in several (way too many) instances, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous (but still somewhat better) film. The original Corpse Grinders already set a very low bar for quality, and yet, somehow, this sequel managed to dive even deeper into the realm of cinematic absurdity. From the very beginning, viewers are subjected to a series of nonsensical plot twists and turns that defy any semblance of logic or coherence. It's as if the filmmakers threw together a collection of random scenes without any regard for storytelling or structure. In several instances, the film seems to actively challenge the audience to make sense of its bewildering narrative choices. The introduction of weird aliens serves only to further confuse and complicate an already tangled storyline. It's almost impressive how the film manages to sustain such a level of absurdity throughout its entire runtime. Despite these glaring issues, or perhaps because of them, Corpse Grinders 2 holds a certain charm for those who revel in the art of watching truly terrible movies. There's a kind of misguided ambition in its execution that makes it a fascinating train wreck to behold. It's difficult to fathom why anyone would greenlight a sequel to an already unsuccessful and horrendous film, yet here it is, existing in all its bizarre glory. For those who appreciate the art of the ""so-bad-it's-good"" genre, this film is a treasure trove of unintentional comedy and head-scratching moments.

Cinderella finally gets her dream and wish and is able to attend. Her captive beauty, generosity, and beautiful nature help her win her prince.

Cinderella's story is truly enchanting. The way she endures all the hardships with grace and kindness is inspiring. Despite the cruelty of her stepmother and stepsisters, Cinderella never loses her gentle spirit. Her friendship with the little mice and her dog, Bruno, adds a touch of warmth and humor to the story, showing that even in difficult times, true friends can make a world of difference. The arrival of the royal ball invitation marks a turning point in Cinderella's life. Her determination to attend the ball, despite the obstacles thrown her way, is a testament to her resilience and hope. The magical transformation by her fairy godmother is a moment of pure wonder, symbolizing the idea that dreams can come true with a little bit of faith and magic.

At the ball, Cinderella captivates everyone with her beauty and grace, especially the prince. Their connection is immediate and undeniable, a true fairy tale moment.

Even when the clock strikes midnight, and Cinderella must leave, the memory of her beauty and spirit lingers with the prince. The search for the mysterious girl who stole his heart leads to a joyful and satisfying conclusion, proving that true love will always find a way.

Cinderella's tale is a celebration of hope, resilience, and the belief that love conquers all. It's a story that has resonated with audiences for generations, and its timeless message continues to inspire. Disney's adaptation beautifully captures the magic and wonder of this classic tale, making it a beloved masterpiece for all ages. Cinderella's journey from rags to riches, from hardship to happiness, is a testament to the enduring power of love and the triumph of the human spirit."

It explores intricate family dynamics and personal struggles, painting a vivid picture of how sometimes everyone is to blame for the ensuing chaos. This movie stands out not only for its compelling narrative but also for the outstanding performances by the cast. The movie showcases some of the best acting that I have seen in TV movies, which elevates its impact significantly. Beverly D'Angelo delivers a nuanced performance, capturing the essence of a mother who is loving yet blind to what is happening under her own roof. Her performance adds depth to the story, making the audience sympathize with her character's plight.

Rob Estes is at his best here, portraying the sleazeball character of Billy with convincing ease. He brings complexity to his role, making it both believable and engaging. However, Jenny Lewis is the true standout in this film. She seems to embody her character, Jade, with such authenticity that it's as if she becomes Jade. Her portrayal adds an emotional weight to the film, making her character's journey all the more compelling and relatable.

Everyone seems to love this movie, and it's easy to see why. It strikes a chord with audiences through its powerful storytelling and remarkable performances, ensuring it remains a memorable and impactful viewing experience."
"This is so exciting! After I saw ""La Roue"" this afternoon, a short, light-hearted little movie, I consider this one a real treat! This is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures I saw this year. It is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the 30's to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema. It's simply filled with music and an adorable mood that's really upbeat and, bottom line, it made me happy! Obviously it wouldn't be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for, but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that I didn't even think of it twice. The comedy is many times hilarious and I think it is even superior to the Marx Brothers, possibly the biggest comedic force of the time.

"I bought this DVD as part of a set of 50 ""historic classics."" It's hardly a classic, and as the plot was updated to the time of its release, is not historic either.

"First off, the title character is not even the main character of the movie. He is the sidekick of the cult leader. The actor who portrays Igor believed that screaming loud, laughing hysterically, and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people. Igor also had the annoying habit of yelling (because he never actually just spoke) in a high pitched voice. He would also say idiotic one-liners. For example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw, Igor upon seeing this, yells out ""Paul! No Paul! Why'd you do it? I could have cut her clean! So clean!"" In another scene Igor tells a victim that she would have to 'get her own tools for surgery because right now, it was his time to operate.' Aside from the bad acting, the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax, which is Igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed, he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining 'good guys'.

For example, there are some sounds that drone all along, while others appear (though subtle), at certain points to support certain shots.<br /><br />One can see also several types of pans: some go up and down in a gentle back-forth way. There is diagonal pan. Zooms also go back and forth sometimes.<br /><br />The lightning and the composition/disposition of elements in the space is, as usual and obviously, work of a painer/artist. This can be felt even in this crappy room. This is to say: one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look/view and composing the scene. Then comes the forcelines of the visuals: like digonales, parallels, etc. The light's degradées and the colours, although without too much research for textures as in big productions, are fine too. This is an artist's sketch of a sort...<br /><br />All this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the David's touch/feel to it, as with any true artist.",1,1357,True,24390,"This little film is particularly interesting for artists, filmmakers, music creators, or visual artists.

"This movie was so poorly written and directed I fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie.

"Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India.

She wants to succeed, and it's never clear that she won't succeed, despite the odds. <br /><br />The acting that Mr. Domalpalli draws forth from his cast of amateurs is miraculous.

I couldn't tell how good Vanaja's dancing was by Indian standards, but the many dance scenes were spellbinding. (Don't think Bollywood--this is classical dance. It's also very different from ballet, because in ballet the dancer lifts her heels away from the floor. In Sound Indian dance, the heel is the primary contact point.)<br /><br />This is a movie that is not to be missed.

"This game has the(dis)honor of being the first game that I have stopped playing right in the middle of and felt like smashing into bits and then burning. Congratulations. FIRST and LAST Tomb Raider I will ever play I assure you.<br /><br />Plot: Just typing that word made me laugh. There isn't one. Neither is there character development. We finally have a girl heroine who can take care of herself,who isn't a *beeping*mary-sue,but unfortunately she dresses like a slut and her breast are huge. They had to attract the sexist boy gamers you see. Anyway all she does is go in tomb after tomb shooting things as she goes along. Why she does this I have no idea. I had subtitles on and the t.v. as loud as I could and I still didn't understand a damn thing. The development(or lack there of) for her, her two friends and the*villains*were laughable. There also will be levels that you have to go through that do-not give you any hint on what you have to do next and you literally will be in most of the boring as hell tombs for HOURS trying to figure out what the hell you are supposed to be doing. There is one course(out of two) in particular with her on a motorbike(Believe me it is not at all fun)that you will be on for ATLEASE an HOUR with NO save point in sight. That means you get hit by the other motorist and guys in vans shooting at you or you hit a tree you start the hour long trek OVER.<br /><br />Boss Stupid F*ck: You know lets makes the levels very long, have basically no save points, have no story, no character development, give no variety in game play, have most of the music on the longest levels ear-bleeding,and give no hints whatsoever to the player so they can stay even longer in a place instead of getting to the nonexistent plot.<br /><br />Stupid F*ck one: Those sound like bang up ideas.<br /><br />Stupid F*ck two: I concur. Who needs character development ,plot, or unboring game-play.<br /><br />Todd: I'm sorry sir,but these ideas seem like they will extremely p*ss the player off.<br /><br />Boss Stupid F*ck: Shut up Todd. You're fired.<br /><br />Game-play: All she does is shoot. Of course she can flip while SHOOTING, jump while SHOOTING, or kick while again SHOOTING.But flipping, jumping, and kicking does not erase the fact that all she is ultimately doing is SHOOTING.

Congratulations. FIRST and LAST Tomb Raider I will ever play. 

Plot: Just typing that word made me laugh. There isn't one. Neither is there character development. We finally have a girl heroine who can take care of herself, who isn't a *beeping* mary-sue, but unfortunately, she dresses like a slut, and her breasts are huge. They had to attract the sexist boy gamers, you see. Anyway, all she does is go in tomb after tomb shooting things. Why she does this, I have no idea. I had subtitles on and the TV as loud as I could, and I still didn't understand a damn thing. The development (or lack thereof) for her, her two friends, and the *villains* were laughable. There are levels with no hints on what to do next, leaving you in boring tombs for HOURS. There's a motorbike course (not fun) that lasts an HOUR with NO save point. If you get hit or hit a tree, you start over.

Boss Stupid F*ck: Let's make the levels long, have no save points, no story, no character development, no gameplay variety, ear-bleeding music, and no hints.

Stupid F*ck one: Those sound like bang-up ideas.

Stupid F*ck two: I concur. Who needs character development, plot, or unboring gameplay?

Todd: I'm sorry, sir, but these ideas seem like they will extremely p*ss the player off.

Boss Stupid F*ck: Shut up Todd. You're fired.

Gameplay: All she does is shoot. She can flip, jump, or kick while SHOOTING. But flipping, jumping, and kicking do not erase the fact that all she is ultimately doing is SHOOTING. BORING!

Music: The intro music is beautiful. The in-game music goes from tolerable to wanting to cut your ears off.

Visuals: Considering this game was made in 2006, I was expecting the visuals to blow me away. Well, I was blown, but not in a good way.

Bottom-line: This game is a plot-less, no character development mess with a barely dressed unmarysuish (THANKFULLY) young woman in the lead that goes through boring tombs for some boring reason (what that might be, I couldn't tell you) with unimaginative shooting gameplay. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS B.S.! It gets two stars for having a woman who isn't a damsel in distress (no matter how scantily clad she might be) and the beautiful intro music."
"I hate to be the one to rain on a parade (even a small one like this) but from the very first scene, you could tell this film was going to be absolute shite.

I think I need to repeat this - The two lead actors (who stand side by side on the advertisement posters and DVD covers) did not have one scene together!!!! They did not speak to each other and never appeared on screen at the same time. Just about sums up this poor excuse for a movie. False advertisement.<br /><br />The dialogue was painful, every single character in the movie was unrealistic, and un-human like. The scenarios were far fetched, the plot was crap, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played a poor mans Tim from The office), nobody was likable, and worst of all, some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me to switch off, as I couldn't bear to watch, or listen to them any longer.<br /><br />This low budget stinker was an epic fail.

"How viewers react to this new ""adaption"" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted as NOT being a remake of the original 1963 movie (true enough), will be based, I suspect, on the following: those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one...and those who have never been exposed to either, and who are big fans of Hollywood's current trend towards ""special effects"" being the first and last word in how ""good"" a film is, are going to love it.<br /><br />Things I did not like about this adaption:<br /><br />1. It was NOT a true adaption of the book. From the articles I had read, this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to. And, that seemed reasonable, no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of THE STAND! (And not even then) But, there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at, in the movie. Reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of THE SHINING. I didn't like that, either. What the movie's press release SHOULD have said is...""We got the basic, very basic, idea from Shirley Jackson's book, we kept the same names of the house and several (though not all) of the leading character's names, but then we decided to write our own story, and, what the heck, we watched THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first, and decided to throw in a bit of them, too.""<br /><br />2. They completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts, to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been ""born bad"". No, instead, this ""doctor"" got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their ""insomnia"" (he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear...like lab rats, who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment...nice guy). This doctor, who did not have the same name, by the way, was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day.<br /><br />3. In direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies ""some houses are just born bad"", this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there...and, this time around, Nel gets to unravel the mystery (shades of THE CHANGELING). The only problem was, the so-called mystery was so incoherently told that I'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience...but, then there was no mystery in the first place (not in the book), because the house was bad TO BEGIN WITH. It's first ""victim"" died before ever setting eyes on it.<br /><br />4. The way the character of Luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. He was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house (and was a true skeptic of it's ""history"")...and in this one he was just a winey-voiced, bumbling nerd who couldn't sleep(insomnia remember) and was a compulsive liar.<br /><br />5. I was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word (the scene with Nel's sister's family, and Mrs. Dudley's little opening speech...) to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than THE HAUNTING. It's like it couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to do.<br /><br />6. I missed Nel's narrative through the whole movie. The original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person, through Nel's eyes, and we always were privy to her thoughts. That totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make Nel much more of a heroine. The original Nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister?) and she liked to moan, and she lost her temper... This one was almost too good to be true. This was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer's had obviously been watching GHOST one too many times.<br /><br />7. They changed the history of the house and it's occupents too much. There was no Abigail Crain (the daughter of Hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions), there was no ""companion"", and there was no nursery. There was also no ""Grace"" (wife of the original doctor) and Hugh Crain's wives died in totally different ways. These changes, changed the story WAY too much. I don't know whether the producers of this movie should be glad Shirley Jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should...BE SORRY (if ya get my drift!!! The hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with!!!).<br /><br />In conclusion, let me just leave you with some words from the original Luke (appropriate substitution of the word ""house"" for ""movie""!): ""This 'movie' should be burnt to the ground, and the ground sprinkled with salt!""

"If you like Star Wars/Trek, come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices. It's my top 2 favorite movies of all times, other-worldly-futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"") is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry (a la later Lucas). And just because it was made in 1956, don't assume you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer up. This was the first movie where you COULDN'T. Miracle it was made at ""A-movie"" scale, economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it. And director Wilcox's previous 'hit' was ""Lassie Come Home"". Until I looked him up, I assumed 'Fred Wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous, but at the time didn't want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly a ""B"" genre back then. This was either a very VERY visionary production, or a very fortuitous 'mistake' on the part of the folks who bankroll Hollywood.<br /><br />There are the massive-scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that Lucas used extensively. There are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical 'user interface'; ""computers"", as they've come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works. Star Trek's 'transporter' is there, visually, almost unaltered by Roddenberry 10 years later. And if the Trek/Wars technobabble turns you off, FP's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate, even today. The ""ship"" set is comprehensive, sparklingly realistic, as good as anything you've seen since, and more convincing than anything 'Trek' has done, for TV or film. We didn't get to spend as much time there as I would have liked.<br /><br />If you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently, watching FP will explain all that. It's definitely not 'Wagontrain to the Stars'.",1,1870,True,20268,"If you're a fan of Star Wars or Star Trek, check out where they got their ideas and cinematic devices.

Holly is but one of millions of children worldwide who are sold and trafficked every day.

It remains sensitive and respectful to the gravity of the subject matter.

"I put this film in the queue on a whim after a recent trip to NYC, and I couldn't believe I'd never heard of it anywhere! It has all the makings of a cult classic, starting with the characters.

They are archetypal roles we recognize from every stretch of daily life, but were so nuanced and fully realized by the actors playing them. Peter Stormare and Bai Ling's performances were particularly strong, as they brought a depth and authenticity to their roles that truly stood out. The way they embodied their characters made it seem as if they were living and breathing the very essence of the personas they portrayed, capturing the intricacies and subtleties of human nature in a way that resonated deeply with me.

Their interactions are poignant and grounded while at the same time brimming with a subtle, quirky humor that is (sadly) all too rare in American films these days. This humor is not over-the-top or forced; instead, it is woven seamlessly into the fabric of the story, creating moments that are both touching and amusing. These interactions feel genuine and relatable, reflecting the complexities and contradictions of real-life relationships. The balance between the comedic elements and the more serious undertones is handled with great skill, ensuring that the film maintains a sense of authenticity and sincerity throughout.

Writer/director Ramin Niami does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes together into a funny and moving portrait of a city of the past. His ability to capture the essence of New York City, with all its vibrancy and diversity, is truly remarkable. The film serves as a nostalgic homage to a bygone era, transporting viewers to a time and place that feels simultaneously familiar and foreign. The way Niami crafts each scene, with meticulous attention to detail, contributes to the overall richness and depth of the narrative.

Highly recommended! This film is a hidden gem that deserves much more recognition. It offers a unique and refreshing perspective, with its finely drawn characters and engaging storyline. Whether you're a fan of character-driven dramas, or simply looking for something different and thought-provoking, this film is sure to leave a lasting impression. Don't miss out on the opportunity to experience this captivating and heartfelt cinematic journey."
"""Quintet"" is definitely not a film most people would find amusing or even interesting for that matter. There is no scene, dialog, acting or plot development that would light a spark. The icy world is one thing, but muddled plot is something you really can't bear. The characters are not only three-dimensional, they're not even one-dimensional, there is no emotion and there is no sense in anything that goes on. There is a world encased in ice, where nobody is doing any meaningful work, except playing Quintet, and the rules to the game are never even hinted.

There is wood, but there are no animals, except dogs, so where do clothes come from, or shoes for that matter, since, apparently there is no industry, and everybody is dressed as in 16th century Europe, which is in odd contrast to not so futuristic pavilion backdrop.

Desolation or hopelessness have nothing to do with lack of appeal to this movie, the world of George Lucas's ""THX1138"" is no brighter place and characters are no more fun, but the story has it's path. In Quintet, there is no obvious or even hinted path, and in my opinion it doesn't even provoke thinking about the idea behind it all, as, for example, similar film, John Boorman's ""Zardoz"".

It starts off on a reasonably good note, creating a sense of intrigue and setting up what seems like it could be an engaging narrative. However, as the film progresses, it becomes increasingly bizarre and hard to swallow, losing the initial momentum it had. The storyline takes unexpected turns that, rather than adding depth, detract from the overall cohesiveness of the film. It spirals into a series of implausible events that challenge the viewer's willingness to suspend disbelief. Amidst this chaos, the sole highlight of the film is Rachel Leigh Cook, who delivers a tender and sexy performance that stands out against the otherwise lackluster backdrop. Her portrayal is nuanced and compelling, providing a spark of brilliance in an otherwise disappointing movie. However, despite her commendable performance, I would recommend this film only to those who are die-hard fans of the actress.

There were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties, but of all the ones I've seen; this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their uncaring attitude about things, which takes the story onto another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and it's played out by complex characters. The film begins with a murder. We then follow the murderer, nicknamed John, as he goes back to school and tells all his friends about what he has done. Rather than give the expected reaction, most of them hardly react at all and the strongest reaction that the murderer gets comes from Layne; who makes it his number one priority to help John clear up the mess he's in and get him out of it. The other friends mull over the crime, and before long one of them goes to the police...<br /><br />River's Edge features a host of great performances from its young cast. Keanu Reeves has a reputation for wooden acting, and for good reason; but he fits in very well to this early role and this performance is easily one of his best. Crispin Glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane Layne. Glover always stands out in every film he's in, and while he does go over the top a little bit; he convinces well as the lead in this movie. Reeves and Glover receive good support from a talented young cast that includes Daniel Roebuck and Joshua john Miller, as well as the great Dennis Hopper in another wild role. The film features a very gritty picture which bodes well with its nihilistic tone. The central characters are all of the 'slacker/stoner' generation and the way that they genuinely don't seem to care about the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself; and the point that the film tries to make about modern society is both strong and well defined. The film is also rather funny, owing to some of the characters' lines; but the humour is pitch black and clearly this film was never meant to be a comedy. Overall, this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing!",1,2290,True,39506,"""River's Edge"" is an excellent film that deserves more recognition in cinematic history. Among the gritty '80s films about school kids, it's the most nihilistic and disturbing. The storyline, combined with the theme of teenage slackers and their indifferent attitudes, elevates the film. It starts with a murder, and we follow the murderer, John, who casually tells his friends. Surprisingly, most don't react, except Layne, who prioritizes helping John. Eventually, one friend does go to the police.

The film boasts great performances from its young cast. Keanu Reeves, often critiqued for wooden acting, fits well in this role, delivering one of his best performances. Crispin Glover stands out as the slightly insane Layne, and while he can be over the top, he convinces as the lead. Reeves and Glover are supported by a talented cast, including Daniel Roebuck, Joshua John Miller, and Dennis Hopper in another wild role. The gritty picture complements its nihilistic tone. The characters' indifference to the murder is more shocking than the crime itself, making a strong statement about modern society. The film is also darkly funny, though never meant to be a comedy. Overall, ""River's Edge"" is an excellent and memorable film worth seeing!"
"As a camera operator, I couldn't help but admire the great look that this picture achieved. The performances were excellent, as was the story. Just when I thought this film was about to slow down, it didn't.

The visual aesthetics were truly remarkable, and every frame seemed meticulously crafted to enhance the storytelling experience. The performances were excellent, each actor bringing depth and authenticity to their roles, making the characters feel real and relatable. The story was equally compelling, drawing me in with its intricate plot and emotional depth. Just when I thought this film was about to slow down, it didn't. The narrative maintained its momentum, propelling the audience forward with heart-pounding tension that kept us on the edge of our seats.

The great pacing through editing was a standout feature, seamlessly transitioning between scenes and maintaining a rhythm that perfectly matched the film's tone. The score was another highlight, knowing exactly when to be quiet and when to swell, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene without overpowering it. All these elements came together under competent and capable direction, showcasing a director's vision that was both clear and compelling.

The camera was always in the right place, capturing each moment with precision and artistry. The framing, angles, and movements all contributed to a visual narrative that was as engaging as it was beautiful. Love that. The attention to detail in every aspect of the production was evident, resulting in a film that was not only entertaining but also a testament to the skill and dedication of everyone involved."
"Woeful and unnecessary sequel to a bonafide classic.

"Without doubt, one of the worst films ever made. Sluggish and without structure, tension or story, the film coasts on the thin premise of ""putting together a show"".

"A whole lot of the people that have seen this are confused, obviously. The original title of ""Cottonmouth Joe"" would've put things into better perspective for much of the viewing audience.

In my opinion, we need more films or movies like this to keep the South Asian culture alive and thriving. The film has a unique way of showcasing the richness and vibrancy of our culture, which is something that should be cherished and celebrated.

Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao acted extremely well in this movie, delivering performances that were both compelling and heartfelt. Their on-screen chemistry is undeniable, and it is this chemistry that draws a lot of people to the movies. Their couple attracts a lot of people to the theaters and adds an extra layer of allure to the film. This is a must-see movie, perfect for those who enjoy a family-friendly and romantic experience. 

The movie is also from the talented makers of ""Hum Saath Saath Hain"" and ""Hum Apke Hain Kon,"" two other beloved films that have left a lasting impact on Bollywood cinema. However, this movie is their best right now, setting a new standard for storytelling and emotional depth. The setting of the movie was beautiful, capturing picturesque landscapes and intricate details that also serve as a huge attraction for viewers. The cinematography complements the storyline perfectly, creating a visual feast that enhances the overall experience.

I was genuinely intrigued by the prospect of watching a young Kim Bassinger, as I had heard so much about her early work. With the added promise of a ""gripping suspense"" as highlighted by my TV guide, I thought I was in for a treat, especially since it was supposedly three-star rated. However, it quickly became apparent that the rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel, given how utterly disappointing the film was. The only suspense I experienced was whether I would manage to finish watching it or not. Robert Culp’s performance was nothing short of disastrous, marking what has to be the low point of his career. His portrayal of a cop was far from believable, making it difficult to invest in the storyline. At one point, the film became so absurd that EVERYBODY was a suspect, including a frail old woman, which was more laughable than suspenseful. If you’re in the mood to deliberately watch something that is badly written, badly directed, and badly acted, then by all means, go for it. It might just make you appreciate truly fine films by comparison. As for me, I wish I could get that hour and thirty-six minutes of my life back."

"It is in the opinion of this reviewer that the best time to be a child was in the 1990's, a period when cartoons were not heavily censored and talented and creative minds were responsible for some of the best family entertainment to hit the air-waves. The best producers of Saturday morning animation were at Warner Brothers Television, who experienced a major Golden Age with the dream-team of Steven Spielberg, Tom Ruegger and Paul Dini. Along with serious and dark series like Batman, they also revived zany, outlandish cartoons made famous by the Looney Tunes. Animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humour and homages to the celluloid of yesteryear and today, but Tiny Toon Adventures was equally popular by re-inventing the Looney Tunes for a new generation, while still keeping that crazy cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that can hold onto any age group, no matter how old. Even when the Tiny Toons were stretched to a feature-length with How I Spent My Vacation, it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series, a curse that so often plagues other feature-length adaptations of popular animated shows.<br /><br />The Tiny Toon Gang are young off-springs of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laugh back in the 1940's and 1950's and are currently learning cartoon comedy to ""earn their Toon Degree."" Summer Vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babs Bunny (Tress MacNeille) start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to Acme Acres getting flooded and them both sailing down the Mississippi. Plucky Duck (Joe Alaskey) joins Hamton Pig (Don Messick) on a cross-country car trip to the Happiest Theme Park in the World, but Hamton's family proves to be more difficult than he imagined. Meanwhile, in other stories scattered throughout, Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) tries to find a cat to hug and squeeze, Fifi Le Fume (Kath Soucie) attempts to go out on a date with her favourite skunk star and Shirley the Loon (Gail Matthius) goes to the cinema with a loud-mouth Fowlmouth (Rob Paulen).<br /><br />While the premise sounds thin for a feature-length film, the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together. The best of these is Plucky's unfortunate road trip, which utilises a golden comedic opportunity very well: feeling pity for somebody, while also laughing at their predicament. Plucky's annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation, all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork. Elmyra's story definitely ranks second just to see how a little, almost innocent girl can cause fear into so many jungle animals. The aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the fore-front with Buster and Babs' story, which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes, but also nostalgically, since Ruegger and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment. Practically half of that segment plays as a parody and homage to Deliverance, including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene, featuring the unforgettable Tiny Toon Adventures theme song.<br /><br />Part of the universal appeal of the Tiny Toons is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does not at all deserve the title of ""children's fare"" that people seem to slap it with. An entire segment featuring Fowlmouth's poor etiquette at the cinema pokes fun at yappers in a note-perfect way, along with an additional jab at Lucasfilm's THX logo. That scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing. There are also a couple of moments that poke fun at Disney World, cinematic plot holes and even Warner's legal department. The fact that today's cartoons are bland and un-creative makes those intelligent moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated series that will come close.<br /><br />After watching How I Spent My Vacation for the first time in many years, I can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to. With the ongoing censorship that today's family entertainment receive, one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again. This review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film, but also a plea for Spielberg, Ruegger and Dini to team up again and bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again. Lord knows that the children of the twenty-first century is in need for something with the intelligence of Tiny Toon Adventures. This is not a simple cash-grab, it is a wonderful film with full of spirit, madcap mayhem and hilarity.",1,4765,True,42424,"In the opinion of this reviewer, the best time to be a child was the 1990s when cartoons were less censored, and creative minds delivered exceptional family entertainment.

Animaniacs was a hit with its dark adult humor, while Tiny Toon Adventures reinvented the Looney Tunes for a new generation, maintaining cartoon violence and intelligent comedy that appeals to all ages.

Despite the thin premise, the directors and screenwriters make the stories work well. Plucky's road trip shines as a comedic gem, blending pity and humor. Elmyra's story ranks second, showcasing how an innocent girl can terrify jungle animals. Buster and Babs' story highlights cartoon violence and nostalgia, with a clever twist on Deliverance's dueling banjos scene using the Tiny Toon Adventures theme.

Tiny Toons' universal appeal lies in its intelligent humor, targeting subjects with ferocity, transcending the ""children's fare"" label. Fowlmouth's cinema etiquette segment perfectly mocks yappers and jabs at Lucasfilm's THX logo. The scene deserves to be shown before every cinema screening, and the film pokes fun at Disney World, plot holes, and Warner's legal department. Today's bland and uncreative cartoons make these intelligent moments even more treasured, as no animated series comes close.

This connection is a testament to Barker's talent and vision as a director, which is why I firmly believe there is a sequel missing for this one. Barker should have dedicated his creative efforts to developing a sequel for this movie, as it possessed so much potential to expand upon its intriguing storyline and complex characters. Instead, he chose to work on the film Lord of Illusions, which I personally found to be quite disappointing. In my opinion, Lord of Illusions was a real letdown, lacking the captivating elements and originality that made his other works stand out. Its failure to live up to expectations only highlights the missed opportunity for a sequel to this movie. Despite this, the lack of a sequel has not diminished the film's impact, and in fact, it may have contributed to NBreed becoming a dark cult classic within the horror genre. The film's unique atmosphere, combined with Barker's signature style, has allowed it to resonate with audiences over time, cementing its status as a beloved and enduring piece of horror cinema."

The two lead characters and their constant bickering is fun to watch all on its own and the end takes a TCM-like turn which was very well-done. Absolutely worth checking out.",1,798,False,49788,"Two college buddies - one an uptight nerd, the other a rude slob - embark on an adventurous and chaotic road trip through the sprawling countryside. Their journey is filled with unexpected twists and turns, but nothing prepares them for the bizarre and terrifying encounter they are about to face. As they navigate the open road, they suddenly find themselves pursued by a vicious and menacing vehicle, one that looks like a fearsome combination of an army tank and a monster truck. This monstrous machine seems intent on running their car over, creating a nail-biting and adrenaline-pumping chase that keeps you on the edge of your seat. With a stroke of luck and quick thinking, they manage to escape the clutches of this vehicular beast, but their relief is short-lived. In a moment of reckless bravado at a rest stop, one of the buddies decides to take a leak in the top hatch of the mysterious vehicle, inadvertently enraging the already dangerous and enigmatic driver. This act of defiance only escalates their predicament, setting off a chain of events that leads to even more perilous situations.

As the tension mounts, the duo's journey takes an unexpected turn when they pick up a sexy hitchhiker who becomes entangled in their life-threatening ordeal. Her presence adds a new dynamic to the story, bringing both intrigue and complexity to the unfolding drama. MONSTER MAN masterfully balances horror and comedy, delivering a film that is not only extremely entertaining but also packed with suspenseful moments that keep you guessing. The gory scenes are executed with skill, providing the right amount of shock value without overshadowing the comedic elements. The chemistry between the two lead characters, with their constant bickering and contrasting personalities, is a delight to watch and adds a layer of humor that lightens the darker aspects of the narrative. As the film progresses, it takes a surprising turn reminiscent of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, leading to a climax that is both unexpected and thrilling. This well-executed twist adds depth to the story and leaves a lasting impression. Overall, MONSTER MAN is absolutely worth checking out for its unique blend of horror and comedy, engaging characters, and skillful storytelling."

"You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for: The Safety Pin Killer! That's right, in Killer Workout, a dumb slasher movie if I've ever seen one, the unseen murderer dispatches his (or her?) victims with an oversized, novelty safety pin. It is an odd choice to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. Naturally, the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing.<br /><br />As the title suggests, an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect. In fact, the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer, just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed. And since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead, it's really just process of elimination. <br /><br />Oddly, while the entire name cast is killed off, the aerobics classes continue in earnest.

"Story about four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most level-headed of the bunch--but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents.

I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the film) and I was surprised at how realistic it was. They got the dialogue, clothes and attitudes down completely right. Even the main song of the movie (""On the Radio"" by Donna Summer) was a big hit before this came out. This film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew girls in high school who were just like this! The film is (of course) dated but it captures a time we will never see again.<br /><br />The acting is good on all counts with Foster giving the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and well-done. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) more or less realistically played a teen boy.<br /><br />A very good movie--essential viewing if you came of age in 1980.

"Stylish, moody, innovative revenge-driven bloodbath. Also cheesy, of course, and sporadically very cheesy. It reminded me a lot of The Big Heat because it has the revenge plot set off by the exact same event, and the girl comes around to the good guy's side because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy. It's sad there's no Gloria Grahame but so fantastic that it's Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Could there be anyone as beautiful as Alain going around in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat? Yet he's totally tough and icy cool. No one nowadays can touch him--though someone like Jude Law could try I guess. Hard for any girl to look good with him. The music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car chases (and those aren't generally my cup of tea)--especially one willy nilly one in the woods. People also met their dooms in creative and bloody fashion, for instance in a junkyard cruncher. But beyond the cheese, the overall atmosphere was affecting and expertly pulled off.

These elements, while controversial, are integral to the film's exploration of its themes, serving as both a mirror and a critique of the subcultures it portrays. The film’s audacious approach to storytelling and its unapologetic depiction of its characters' lives make it a unique experience, albeit one that might not resonate with everyone. Yet, it remains a curious piece of cinema that, in its own way, captures the essence of a particular time and place, as well as the complexities and contradictions inherent in human behavior."

The storyline doesn't hold up well over time, and while some of the special effects might have been impressive back in the day, they now come across as rather dated and ineffective. The film tries to build suspense, but it struggles to maintain the audience's interest due to its sluggish pace. The moments that do shine are few and far between, and it often feels like you're waiting for something to happen that never quite does. The characters lack depth, and their interactions often feel forced and unnatural, making it difficult to become invested in their plight. Overall, while the movie might have had its charm in the 50s, it doesn't quite stand the test of time, and viewers may find themselves yearning for more excitement and less exposition."
"Facts about National Lampoon Goes to the Movies, a.k.a. National Lampoon's Movie Madness:<br /><br />1. The movie is poor, even by Lampoon's typical standards. 2. It's not funny. 3. No one goes to see a movie.<br /><br />So, after I finished watching it, I began wondering why on earth it's called 'National Lampoon Goes to the Movies,' and why it was ever conceived, much less actually made. It would be like calling Austin Powers 'An American Guy Goes to the Movies.' How lame. He isn't American, and he doesn't go to movies. None of the characters in Lampoon's so-called 'satire' are funny, and none go see movies, which causes a bit of a problem. I had hoped it would be something in the vein of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it isn't.<br /><br />This was National Lampoon's first film after Animal House, although you couldn't tell it from the quality of film. Poorly developed, rough and amateurish by any standard, it induces headaches  not a good sign for an 89-minute movie that seems double the length.<br /><br />I've noticed a pattern. Really bad movies are typically renamed  and this little disaster falls under that category. It has two separate titles -- probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in 1982/83.

I give up.",0,4710,True,7180,"Facts about National Lampoon Goes to the Movies, a.k.a. National Lampoon's Movie Madness:

1. The movie is poor, even by Lampoon's typical standards.
2. It's not funny.
3. No one goes to see a movie.

After watching it, I wondered why it's called 'National Lampoon Goes to the Movies.' None of the characters are funny, and none go see movies. I had hoped it would be like Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it isn't.

This was National Lampoon's first film after Animal House, but its quality is poor. It's poorly developed, rough, and amateurish, inducing headaches—not good for an 89-minute movie that seems double the length.

Really bad movies are typically renamed—this one has two titles, likely to trick people into watching it. 'Movie Madness—I’ve never heard of this. Let's rent it!' And then the realization: 'Hey, wait, this is just National Lampoon Goes to the Movies!'

Shelved by MGM/UA, it was never released in theaters or on DVD; it occasionally appears on TV.

It's split into three stories—a parody of self-enlargement videos, butter and corporate ruthlessness, and police brutality/cop-buddy films. The first segment stars Peter Riegert as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does other stuff. It was so boring my mind drifted until the sex scene.

Part II is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter (don't ask) who becomes Queen of the Margarine to cut off dairy products. The only funny line: 'Only I can make love with my son!' If you think that doesn't sound funny, you're right—it's not. And it's the highlight of this film!

Part III is about a cop who chases a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) but loses his nerve and shoots him. It contains one funny scene, extremely over-acted; only Lloyd is humorous, playing his character dry and compassionate, yet surreal. The choking scene evoked a chuckle.

It's a shame to see a cast of semi-famous names resort to low standards. The writers believe they're being ironic and clever by spoofing stereotypes, but the movie becomes a contradiction, favoring T & A over plot; crude humor over witty dialogue; desperate over inspired performances. The actors seem embarrassed, muttering their lines, seldom making eye contact with the camera.

The movie isn't funny. I laughed once, at one line, and it was halfhearted. Two chuckles, a smile, and a weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, other comedies seem like laugh tracks.

I like National Lampoon's Vacation series (or three of four) and Animal House, but their direct-to-video bombs like Golf Punks (with comic genius Tom Arnold) show why their magazine went out of print. It gets old, fast.

Sad to see a new film, Gold Diggers, released with their 'stamp of approval.' It's like condemning a film before it hits theaters—maybe they should not advertise their name.

Distributor: 'This movie is bad. It gets the National Lampoon stamp of approval. That'll teach you not to make something so awful next time.'

Forget the death penalty. Just make criminals watch this over and over for a month.

It's so bad I can't explain its vileness. I give up."
"This is one of those rare comedies where try as you might, you can't help but giggle, chortle, guffaw and yes, even laugh out loud. The lead actor's performance as Hyde is pure manic genius.

The film manages to capture a unique blend of humor that resonates with audiences, pulling laughter from even the most stoic of viewers. The lead actor's performance as Hyde is nothing short of pure manic genius, showcasing an impressive range of comedic talent that is both captivating and entertaining. His portrayal brings an energy to the screen that is infectious, making it virtually impossible not to be swept up in the hilarity. See if you can keep a straight face when he does his transformation—it's a challenge that adds another layer of fun to the experience. Good luck with that. :)

On the downside, there are times when the movie does bog down, losing a bit of its momentum. These moments can feel like a slight lull in the otherwise rapid pace of the comedy, and at times, the narrative seems to drag. It seemed longer than its 90 minutes, which can be attributed to these slower segments that interrupt the flow of the humor. However, despite these occasional dips in energy, the overall charm and wit of the film manage to prevail, leaving you with a memorable comedic experience."
"This is one of those star-filled over-the-top comedies that could a) be hysterical, or b) wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead. Unfortunately, One Night at McCool's is a classic ""b.""<br /><br />Goldie Hawn recently commented about ""Town and Country"" that it's a big problem in Hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed. You have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script, they also mangled it daily. Maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say, ""It's the script, stupid."" <br /><br />This is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through. They're working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical, but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre.<br /><br />Is it an unmitigated disaster?

Suffice it to say that as soon as you see John Goodman behind a bent-over Paul Reiser (nothing given away here. It's in the trailer), get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking, ""Eh. It was okay."" The rest of the movie is tacked-on and creatively bankrupt. And you'll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess. <br /><br />If you loved ""There's Something About Mary"" or ""Meet The Parents"" (both GREAT movies), then don't bother to see this movie.

PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR in comparison to this, I must say. At the end, when Dickie gets thrown off the boat, it is so funny (the hair is different from his, and I like it when he flips everyone off). This film should only be bought if you're a true Adam Sandler fan. It's really something that only the most dedicated fans of Adam Sandler would appreciate or even consider adding to their collection. 

The characters are poor in comparison to his funny films like The Waterboy, which has the same people in it, such as Peter Dante, who is one of the assassins trying to kill the Australian bird. This film lacks depth and a decent storyline and deserves to be in the bottom 100. The lack of depth in the film is quite noticeable, especially when you compare it to some of his more successful and well-regarded movies. It feels like the story doesn't have enough substance to keep the audience engaged, and the characters don't have enough development to make them interesting or relatable. 

It's really a shame because Adam Sandler has been in some truly hilarious films where the characters are memorable and the plot is engaging, but this one just doesn't hit the mark. It's almost like the film was rushed or not given the attention it needed during the writing process, resulting in something that feels incomplete and unsatisfying. The humor, while present in some scenes, doesn't carry the film the way it does in his more successful comedies. 

In comparison to his other works, this film just doesn't measure up, and it's disappointing because it had the potential to be so much more. Adam Sandler has proven time and time again that he has the comedic talent and charisma to carry a film, but unfortunately, this one doesn't showcase those strengths. Instead, it falls flat and leaves the audience wanting more – more laughs, more engaging characters, and a more cohesive storyline. 

Overall, while the film does have its moments, it's not enough to save it from being one of Adam Sandler's weaker projects. If you're a die-hard fan, you might find some enjoyment in it, but for most viewers, it will likely be a forgettable experience."

"There are some good things about the movie. The music and cinematography is great. Alex Wilson is hot and gives a great performance. Ryan Bauer is also hot.

"Something I think some people miss about great science fiction is that it predicts some part of the future.

I'm not going to argue that. It's probably a true statement about a quite big part of the population (the part I despise, by the way). And even if this weren't true, that's not my point. The worst sin ""Fuckland"" committed was to express such a statement about its own director.<br /><br />The continuous impression I received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for sneaking a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good (even a mediocre) movie. Many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless. The director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and his own ones. And there's no plot at all.<br /><br />Moreover, this movie proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening titles, only to disrespect its principles afterwards (for example, by including the director in the credits - another sign of his pride?).<br /><br />I found the movie offensive, not as an Argentinian, but as a watcher. I felt underestimated.

The film supposedly critiques Argentinians, portraying us as boastful over petty victories and self-important. While this may be true for some, that's beside the point. The film's gravest flaw was reflecting this criticism onto its own director. 

The director seemed more focused on impressing us with the feat of sneaking a camera into the islands than on crafting a decent film. Many hidden camera shots felt pointless, and the editing of old war footage with new scenes was silly. There was no plot whatsoever.

Furthermore, the film flaunts a Dogme certificate but then disregards its principles, like including the director in the credits—another sign of his arrogance. I found ""Fuckland"" offensive not as an Argentinian, but as a viewer. It underestimated its audience and remains one of the worst movies I've ever seen."

The script has a knack for building suspense and never fails to place poor Charlotte in a precarious situation).<br /><br />ACTING: $$$$ (Betty Chandler does the best job here as Allyson, capturing dementia with naiveté in an ethereal form. The Judge was splendid as well, weighing facts before he came to a verdict while Rosie Holotik as Charlotte gives a genuine performance as you will feel for her character)."
"I thought that Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a woman of 30, with no children, I still seem to really enjoy these humorous, witty animated movies. Sid is the best character I have seen in some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really humorous, and I did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the movie at least 15 times (I own it obviously) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasions...yes,still). My favourite scene is the part where Sid says ""Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!"" and Sid and Manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the ""tigers""...""Pack of wolves, pack of bears, pack of fleas, pack of whiskers, pack of noses, pack a derm?, pack of lies, pack of troubles, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish..."" or however that part goes!

"This is a long lost horror gem starring Sydney Lassick (""Carrie"" and others) and Barbara Bach. It is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it. This film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time. It seems that 3 young newswomen (Karen, Vicky, and Jennifer) travel to the small city of Solvang, California to cover a festival when a mix-up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of Earnest Keller (Lassick) and his strange wife Virginia. Vickie stays behind, feeling ill, as the other 2 are off to film their story. She is soon murdered at the house, in a VERY cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement). Soon Karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover. Jennifer is fighting with her (ex?)lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home, her hosts (whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son) devise a plot to try to murder her as well. Virgina does not totally agree with Earnest's plan to murder Jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets Junior. Here the film turns almost comic as Junior (portrayed hysterically by Stephen Furst) is a deformed, mentally deficient, manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary. This is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done.

"Vanaja is a film of superlatives. It has an exceptionally well thought-out cast with Mamatha being the crowning jewel, a superb production and possibly pre-production with Rajnesh at the helm, a fantastic journey of rural Southern India through the eyes of a 15 year old, a remarkable mixture of song and dance, traditional and modern, blended perfectly, and a beautiful backdrop of lush color of the flora and fauna that make up the magnificent experience.

This film will remain as one of my top favorites for my entire life. 9/10.",1,672,False,45343,"""Vanaja"" is a film of superlatives, a cinematic gem that stands out in every aspect. It has an exceptionally well thought-out cast, with Mamatha being the crowning jewel, bringing a depth and authenticity to her role that captivates the audience from start to finish. The film boasts a superb production and possibly pre-production, with Rajnesh at the helm, guiding the film with a visionary touch that is rarely seen, especially in debut directors. The narrative takes us on a fantastic journey through rural Southern India, seen through the eyes of a 15-year-old, offering a perspective that is both enlightening and heartwarming.

The film is a remarkable mixture of song and dance, seamlessly blending traditional and modern elements. This blend is executed so perfectly that it enhances the storytelling, adding layers of cultural richness and emotional depth. The musical sequences are not just interludes but integral parts of the narrative, highlighting the characters' emotions and the story's progression.

Adding to the film's allure is the beautiful backdrop of lush color provided by the flora and fauna, creating a visual experience that is truly magnificent. The cinematography captures the essence of the rural landscape, making it a character in its own right, and providing a stunning setting for the unfolding drama.

What a towering achievement for a debut director! Rajnesh has not only crafted a compelling story but has also paid meticulous attention to every detail, ensuring that the film resonates with authenticity and passion. The casting was absolutely dead-on, with each actor delivering performances that are both convincing and memorable. Mamatha's portrayal is particularly noteworthy, as she brings a nuanced performance that anchors the film.

I wish India would come out with more of such films, as ""Vanaja"" sets a high standard for storytelling and artistic expression. This film will remain as one of my top favorites for my entire life, a testament to its enduring impact and the emotional connection it fosters with its audience. It is a cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression, deserving of every accolade it receives. 9/10."

I won't bother with a synopsis of the plot, because I genuinely feel it's not worth delving into the details. Instead, I suggest you do something else for 90 minutes that might be more rewarding or enjoyable. There are countless other activities or films that would likely offer a better use of your time. Whether it's reading a book, taking a walk, or watching a different movie, there are many alternatives that could provide a more satisfying experience.

It's a turkey, and then some. What the movie really is is a chaotic mishmash of mismatched footage, cobbled together from early sound films and silent films. This is then mixed with poorly shot recent footage, or at least recent at the time of its release, showing men on a safari. The scenes are so disjointed that it's hard to believe they were intended to be part of the same narrative. For example, there is a man in a gorilla suit, inexplicably thrown into the mix, as well as scenes of south seas natives at sea, inexplicably used to represent people supposedly in the middle of Africa. The absurdity doesn't end there; women in bikinis pop up randomly, adding to the hodgepodge of unrelated visuals. The narration is atrocious, adding yet another layer of comedy, albeit unintentionally. There's also a guy in a loincloth, his body covered in makeup that seems racially insensitive, to say the least. This movie is the kind of cinematic disaster that's best watched in the company of friends who are ready to provide witty commentary and plenty of alcoholic drinks.

Other reviewers mentioned ""Troubled Production"" and it shows.<br /><br />At the end I just didn't even care about the fight scenes, sure, the CGI Dragon was weak, but the storyline was the biggest letdown.",0,736,False,29718,"This movie starts out great, and really sucks you in with its intriguing premise and captivating opening scenes. It manages to hold your attention with strong performances from most of the cast. The majority of the acting is genuinely good, and it keeps you engaged until Patrick Swayze makes his entrance. His character, complete with a Texas Twang that feels out of place, is a stark contrast to the rest of the cast, who sound distinctly British-like—even the Muslim character fits this tone. This disparity in accents is jarring and unfortunately highlights that Patrick Swayze, in this particular role, can't quite deliver a convincing performance. Despite this, you might be willing to overlook it until the first fight scene, where things take a turn for the worse. 

In this scene, everything seems to fall to pieces. The choreography is lacking, and the execution leaves much to be desired. It's puzzling why Patrick Swayze chooses to fight the baddies with an ax, especially considering he had just dramatically stuck his sword into the ground a mere five minutes earlier. This inconsistency is frustrating for viewers who are trying to follow the logic of the action sequences. 

A few minutes later, the film presents further confusion with the misplacing of swords, which occurs again, adding to the disjointed feeling of the narrative. Characters inexplicably seem to have knowledge about other people they shouldn't be aware of, which disrupts the story's coherence. Other reviewers have mentioned ""Troubled Production,"" and this aspect is evident throughout the film. The lack of continuity and logical progression detracts from the overall experience. 

As the movie progresses, the storyline becomes increasingly muddled, and by the end, I found myself not even caring about the fight scenes, which should have been a highlight. The CGI Dragon, which could have been a redeeming feature, was unfortunately weak and did little to enhance the film. Ultimately, the storyline proved to be the biggest letdown, overshadowing any potential the movie had at its outset. Despite its promising start, the film fails to deliver a satisfying conclusion, leaving viewers disappointed."

The one thing that makes it somewhat palatable is its cool Australian backdrop, despite the fact that they spend the vast majority of the movie in one place."
"The movie is more about Pony than Grey Owl. It's also about aboriginals, Canada, the English, Grey Owl's aunts and the North Bay Nugget.

It's also about aboriginals, Canada, the English, Grey Owl's aunts, and the North Bay Nugget. Excellent story. This film delves deeply into the intricate dynamics of its characters and their surroundings, weaving a narrative that is as complex as it is engaging. In exploring these themes, it provides a rich tapestry of interactions and conflicts that drive the story forward, making it an unforgettable cinematic experience.

This is an excellent movie, more like a book, that raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The narrative structure allows for a profound exploration of these issues, encouraging viewers to reflect on the nature of identity and the values that define us. The key scene is Grey Owl admitting his imposture to Pony and her reaction. This pivotal moment encapsulates the film's central themes, offering a poignant commentary on authenticity and self-discovery. It is a scene that resonates deeply, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.

A few observations on the user ratings. Note that the user ratings are bi-polar clustering at 5 and 7; it's not for everyone, but has a strong following. This movie is underrated and overlooked but will be noticed for years to come. The stark contrast in ratings highlights the film's polarizing effect, suggesting that while it may not appeal to everyone, it has garnered a dedicated following among those who appreciate its unique approach and storytelling. Also, few women have watched the movie but they rate it more highly than men. This discrepancy raises questions about its marketing strategy and whether it has been effectively targeted to reach its potential audience. Has it been marketed properly? The film's marketing efforts may need to be reassessed to ensure it reaches a wider audience, particularly among those who are likely to appreciate its thematic depth and cultural significance."
"The House of the Spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue, South American politics and super-natural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring Isabel Allende's novel to life with all its passion and suspense. This, in my view, is one of the best films of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba ages and mellows very believably, while Meryl Streep in the role of Clara maintains her gentle, loving warmth throughout her relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as Esteban's sister, gives a very moving performance. The countryside of Portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical Latin American country. Settings of Clara's home and Esteban's ranch are effective and the period US cars add nicely to the post-war atmosphere.",1,861,False,24915,"""The House of the Spirits"" is a gripping and captivating tale of family intrigue, South American politics, and supernatural powers.

"I went into this film expecting it to be similar to The Matrix or Pi. Boy, was I wrong. Yes, there is a poorly written, poorly acted plot in the movie (with CG animated cells and peptides to boot).

On the other hand, it could be seen as a campy comedy (albeit not a funny one).

Save your time and money: don't see this movie."

Initially, I wasn't sure what I was getting into. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian, and she has done a lot of funny movies, such as Sister Act, which is a classic comedy that many people love. Her comedic timing and ability to bring characters to life in a humorous way have always been a highlight of her career.

However, this was not really a comedy. It is a drama with comedic moments interspersed throughout, so if you're looking for a laugh riot, then you might want to keep looking elsewhere. The film has its humorous parts, but its core is more serious and thoughtful, exploring themes that are deeper and more reflective.

This movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood. The transition they experience is central to the story, and it brings about a mix of emotions and challenges that the family must navigate. It is a journey that delves into their experiences and growth as they adapt to their new environment. I would say more about the plot, but I think it would spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it yet.

The movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks, which is a significant theme, but it also explores relationships within the black community itself. This dual focus adds layers to the narrative and makes it a richer experience. The film examines how these relationships evolve and the complexities that arise within different social contexts.

I do think that it is worth giving this movie a chance. It offers a perspective that is engaging and thought-provoking. However, if you're not really interested in seeing another movie about race relations, then this movie might not be for you. It addresses these issues in a meaningful way, but for those seeking a different kind of story, it might not align with their interests. Overall, it's a film that presents a blend of drama and comedy, with a focus on important social themes."

"I happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon. I have to admit that I've never been a big baseball fan, but I can sometimes get into a good sports-related movie. What I found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system. As a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system, I though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system: people jumping from family to family, biological parents not always taking an active involvement, and transitions that can be but heart-wrenching and heart-melting.

I have to admit that I've never been a big baseball fan, as it's not really a sport that has ever captured my interest. However, I can sometimes get into a good sports-related movie, especially when it offers more than just the game itself. What I found more interesting and captivating about this film was its depiction of the foster family system, which was portrayed with a surprising amount of depth and sensitivity. As a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system, I thought it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system. The film didn't shy away from the reality of people jumping from family to family, a situation that is all too common in the foster system. It also touched upon the often painful truth of biological parents not always taking an active involvement in their children's lives, which can lead to feelings of abandonment and hurt. Furthermore, the movie captured the transitions that can be both heart-wrenching and heart-melting, offering a balanced view that felt honest and genuine. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchor of this film, and both bring very believable performances that lend authenticity and warmth to the story. Their portrayals were nuanced and heartfelt, making the characters relatable and sympathetic. Maybe it was just my emotional state at the time, but I did find myself shedding a tear at the end of the film. The combination of the emotional storyline and the strong performances really struck a chord with me, leaving a lasting impression. Overall, it was a movie that not only entertained but also provided a thoughtful exploration of the foster care system, making it a worthwhile watch."
"First off, Mexican Werewolf in Texas' title is misleading as many others have pointed out. It is actually about El Chupacabra, which is a similar creature to a werewolf, but by no means the same.<br /><br />The production and editing just plain suck. When it was over, I probably wouldn't be able to give a very accurate description of what exactly the Chupacabra looked like, for whenever it was in a scene(despite one or two exceptions) the camera turned all shaky and you could only see the monster's face clearly. The special effects were laughably bad, but that has to be expected from a low budget horror movie.<br /><br />Along with the terrible production comes the bad actors. Now a couple give fairly plausible performances(Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but then there were the bad actors(everybody else), who seemed to have no emotions whatsoever when people died. Then there's the absolutely terrible actor(Sara Erikson), who gives one of the 2 worst performances I've ever seen in a movie. I mean my god, she was indescribably bad.<br /><br />The plot was very simple. Basically, a Chupacabra is in a small Texan town killing off local residents and a group of teens look to stop it. However, even with the plot being this simple, a few plot holes managed to leak through.<br /><br />Anyways, horrible movie. However, if you are looking for a movie to make fun of and laugh at with your friends one night, this would be a pretty good one. My friends and I had a good time watching this.

Imagining a revival or a film adaptation brings a sense of excitement and nostalgia, even if it seems unlikely. Fans like me continue to hold onto the hope that one day, somehow, this beloved show might make a comeback in some form. The thought of seeing the characters and stories we love return to the screen is a dream worth holding onto, no matter how slim the chances.

Anyway, I would recommend, if you hadn't seen it, to find the DVD of all 13 episodes because the characters are great, the storylines are good, the comedy is good, and, well, the whole show is just great. Watching it again or discovering it for the first time can be a delightful experience. The charm of the characters and the cleverness of the storylines make it a series that deserves appreciation. Whether you're revisiting it or seeing it anew, the blend of humor, action, and drama offers something for everyone, making it a timeless series that continues to entertain. So, if you get the chance, grab the DVD and immerse yourself in the greatness of this show."

The attention to detail in every frame, the depth of the script, and the clarity and quality of the picture are unrivaled, even after so many years. It’s a piece of art that has stood the test of time, and it continues to exemplify the pinnacle of cinematic achievement in our country. It’s disheartening to see that many do not share this sentiment or take the time to truly appreciate such artistry. I urge everyone to broaden their cinematic horizons and explore films that offer substance and quality.

Until then, I’ll keep hoping for a brighter future for Romanian cinema. KuDos, and I will see you later."
"Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them is a sort of Operatic bordello story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into throes of happiness--only his attempt misses it's only real target, the woman that he pines after. In the same unfinished château he built, a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story, as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical anthropoligist tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group. Meanwhile, a bunch of kids fantasize a George Melies-like adventure of a prince that saves a girl in distress from swamp creatures and then kills the evil king, bringing upon the kingdom of love. The two primary themes? Life is a fairy tale, and Life isn't a fairy tale.<br /><br />Which sounds better than the movie actually is. Resnais is the type of director where oftentimes the concept is good or bad, but the exposition is what matters; here, the concept is great but the movie is downright painful to watch. Horridly off-tune songs, bubbly characters without an ounce of dimension, backdrops of sickening pastel--instead of giving your inner child an ice cream cone, Resnais drowns it in a bucket of cake frosting. Add some French philosophy and you get a weird witches brew, one that doesn't bubble bubble toil and trouble, but just kinda sits wrong in your stomach until you want to regurgitate it.<br /><br />Resnais is a risk-taking director, and even in his worst you can see he's trying something that might not work with full clarity of action. In I Want to Go Home, he manages to pull past annoying characters and ditzy set-pieces by showing some real change and having a moment few moments of quiet to catch his breath. Here he submerges directly into a fantasy that doesn't really reflect fantasy, only its baby's room wallpaper reference. The biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a movie more flamboyant than an 80s pop video, and more kitsch than Golden Era Hollywood musicals. The fantasies are beyond childish and naive, but the movie (with nudity and profanity) is definitely aimed for adults, a target he decidedly missed.<br /><br />However, he sticks closely to his theme and never backpedals.

Trojans looked just like Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen.

Brad Pitt does not blink on camera.

Helen of Troy's biggest line was, ""They're coming for me.""

Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music.

Brad Pitt's thighs go all the way up.

Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close, but it's OK. They were cousins. Never mind what history says.

Peter O'Toole can tell an entire story with just an expression.

Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names, but their statues either looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole in drag.

Greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting, much like American men.

All of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color... Light Egyptian, by Max Factor.

Troy had only three women.

There were lots of blond Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who would otherwise have really stuck out.

Despite their coastal desert locale, Greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires, funeral pyres, Trojan horses and the like.

British actors look silly with Greek hairdos.

Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes.

Greek soldiers fought constantly, but their outfits always looked impeccable.

"Jonathan Demme's directorial debut for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicks-in-chains 70's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid. Beauteous Russ Meyer starlet Eric (""Vixen,"" ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"") Gavin gives a robust, winning performance as a brassy, resilient new fish who does her best to persevere in a grimy, hellish penitentiary. The always fabulous Barbara Steele offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean, crippled, sexually frustrated warden (her erotic dream about doing a slow, steamy striptease in front of the lady inmates is a real dilly). Longtime favorite 70's B-movie actress Roberta (""The Arousers,"" ""Unholy Rollers"") Collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward, foul-mouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells a gut-busting dirty joke about Pinnochio. Lynda Gold (a.k.a. Crystin Sinclaire of Tobe Hooper's ""Eaten Alive"" and Curtis Harrington's ""Ruby"") makes her lively film debut as uninhibited wildcat Crazy Alice. And the ever-cuddly Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith does a lovely, touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from ""Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural."" <br /><br />Although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language, nudity, rape and violence, it's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth; the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force.

Longtime favorite 70's B-movie actress Roberta (""The Arousers,"" ""Unholy Rollers"") Collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward, foul-mouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells a gut-busting dirty joke about Pinocchio.

Although the film delivers ample coarse language, nudity, rape, and violence, it's not a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth; it effectively explores the ways men exploit women and asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome obstacles by banding together.

"First let me preface this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES...I don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the cereal (if there is one). I am simply a fan of the films.<br /><br />With that being said, I struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise. Taking this movie by itself, and not comparing it to it's terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I don't understand how you can say this is an amazing movie. For all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue, contrived scenes (ie R2 suddenly being a badass, and long CGI intense chase scenes that have little human touch), HORRIBLE acting, and noted plot holes...how is this good? There was no real internal dilemma within Anakin; it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden. I was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so (which by the way was ruined by the ""NOOOOOO!"" Frankenstein scene). When you BOMBARD the screen with intensely amazing CGI effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one-liners when more could have and should have been said, this is NOT A GREAT MOVIE. For a film with such a ""dark"" tone, there was too much levity in the speech of ALL characters.<br /><br />I close with a question: From the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place?",0,1437,True,8690,"I'm a fan of the original Star Wars movies, not the books, games, or other merchandise.

"When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall.

My, what we've done to the planet you might think. I hope we get to see other things like this. It's a striking image that sets a certain tone for what you might expect to follow, creating an anticipation for more scenes that delve into similar themes. The opening scene is captivating in its own right, providing a glimpse into the industrial world and hinting at the broader implications of human activity on our environment. The expectation is set for a documentary that will explore these themes in depth and perhaps offer insight or commentary on the current state of our planet. 

That's very rare. When you're not looking at a horribly filmed angle of the narrator at a lecture hall, you're watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations. The frequent cuts to the narrator in awkward angles disrupt the flow and diminish the visual appeal that was initially set up. It feels like a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the subject matter with visuals that could complement the narrative. It'd be nice if he chose areas that were more fitting with his topic but he doesn't. The locations he chooses seem to lack relevance and fail to reinforce the themes being discussed. So, then you'll hear some more narration, watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera. The cycle becomes repetitive and monotonous, detracting from the potential impact the film could have had. Why not use the filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead? The decision to focus so heavily on the narrator's process rather than the subject itself leaves the viewer wanting more substance and depth. It really kills any sense of pacing and paints the guy as more of a vain jerk. The constant return to the narrator's perspective creates a disjointed experience that makes it difficult to stay engaged. 

I could read tips on how someone set up their camera, fast forward through this whole movie and waste a lot less time. The film does not offer much beyond what could be easily found in photography tutorials or online articles, making the viewing experience feel redundant and uninformative. It squanders the potential to provide a unique and insightful exploration of its theme, leaving the audience with little more than a superficial understanding and a sense of time wasted. The lack of engaging content and meaningful visuals makes it difficult to recommend this film to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the issues it purports to address."

Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played this so well. Raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting, Todd (Kurt Russell) is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers. This plot sets the stage for a gripping narrative that explores themes of obsolescence and redemption. The film's atmosphere is crafted with a deft touch, creating an intense and immersive experience that pulls you right into Todd's world. 

As the story unfolds, we witness Todd’s journey of self-discovery, resilience, and ultimately, survival. The isolation of the planet mirrors his internal struggle, and Kurt Russell delivers a performance that is both understated and powerful. His portrayal of Todd is nuanced, capturing the character's hardened exterior and the vulnerability lurking beneath. The action sequences are both thrilling and emotionally charged, highlighting Todd’s skills while also revealing his humanity. 

The stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born - SOLDIER. Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell owns this role and made it entirely his - original, daring, and all too human. The film is a testament to Russell’s ability to carry a movie with minimal dialogue, relying on his physicality and expressive eyes to convey deep emotions. 

I miss the fact that sequels were never made. The potential for further exploration of Todd’s character and his universe is undeniable. It’s a film that stands alone as a unique entry in the action genre, offering both spectacle and substance. The absence of sequels leaves a lingering sense of what could have been, but it also allows SOLDIER to remain an untainted gem, appreciated for its originality and depth.

It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes. That said, it's not that good, and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched. The visual effects and the conceptual design of the movie are intriguing, capturing the attention of the audience with their creativity and innovation. However, despite these appealing elements, the movie falls short in delivering a compelling narrative that matches the ingenuity of its predecessor. The storyline struggles to maintain coherence, and the plot twists, albeit interesting, feel forced and out of place. The characters lack depth and development, making it difficult for viewers to form any meaningful connection with them. This detachment from the characters ultimately diminishes the emotional impact of the film, leaving audiences feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled.

As for calling this another cube-movie is utter and complete bullsh!t. This is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie. The movie seems to be riding on the coattails of its predecessor's success without bringing anything new or innovative to the table. The whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people/androids as part of the ""team"" behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch. This addition to the storyline feels contrived and undermines the original concept that made the first movie so captivating and unique. The mystery and suspense that were central to the original film are diluted by this unnecessary subplot, which detracts from the overall experience.

I gave this a 3*** because of the backstabbing of the original. This one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all. The attempt to expand on the original narrative by introducing new elements and characters falls flat, as it does not complement or enhance the existing storyline. Instead, it creates inconsistencies and plot holes that are difficult to overlook. The pacing of the movie is uneven, with moments of action and intrigue being overshadowed by drawn-out scenes that contribute little to the progression of the plot. This imbalance further detracts from the movie's ability to engage and captivate its audience.

Watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but not recommendable for fans of the series. For viewers unfamiliar with the original films, this movie may offer some entertainment value, with its visually striking scenes and intriguing concepts. However, for fans of the series, this installment is likely to be a disappointment, as it fails to capture the essence and brilliance of the original. The film's shortcomings overshadow its potential, resulting in a lackluster addition to the franchise that is unlikely to leave a lasting impression on its audience."

Remember what she was taught about the mark's mindset when the con is over? The gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very beginning. This is a crucial detail that adds layers to the entire narrative. It makes you rethink everything that transpired and how every single action was part of a meticulously crafted scheme. The intricacy of the plot is such that it lures you into one reality while cleverly orchestrating another behind the scenes. 

When the patient comes back at the end, she was SUPPOSED to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gang splitting up her 80 thousand. This moment is pivotal because it was meant to bring the con full circle, revealing the true extent of the deception. The red convertible wasn't just a car; it was a symbol of freedom and escape, both for the character and metaphorically for the audience breaking free from their initial understanding of the plot. The patient was in on the con from the beginning, an accomplice in the grand scheme, and this revelation changes everything we thought we knew about his role and intentions.

Mantegna does not die in the end - the gun had blanks. This twist redefines the climax of the story, flipping the anticipated tragedy into a moment of revelation. The blanks in the gun are symbolic of the entire narrative's facade, where things are not as they appear and what seems like an ending is actually a new beginning in understanding. There - enough spoilers for you there? This is why people are giving it such high ratings. It's extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons MOST of the audience. The brilliance lies in its ability to deceive not just the characters within the story, but also the viewers themselves, creating a shared experience of having been expertly conned. It's a testament to the film's craft that it can maintain this illusion until the very end, making it a standout in terms of narrative originality and audience engagement."
"I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed.<br /><br />It's true that Frank Sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it's also nice that it's not just another Frank Sinatra movie where it's mostly him doing the singing.<br /><br />I actually thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice as he has the voice that fits and I could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice.<br /><br />Stubby Kaye's ""Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat"" is a foot-tappin', sing-a-long that I just love.

"If you're tired by the same repetitive, unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases, you'll enjoy ""You Are Alone"". It is thought provoking, well shot and riveting.<br /><br />Without revealing anything that you don't find out in the first few minutes of the movie, this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor.

"A routine mystery/thriller concerning a killer that lurks in the swamps. During the early days of television, this one was shown so often, when Dad would say ""What's on TV tonight?"" and we'd tell him ""Strangler of the Swamp"" he'd pack us off to the movies. We went to the movies a lot in those days!",0,299,False,1570,"""Strangler of the Swamp"" is a routine mystery/thriller that revolves around a killer who lurks menacingly in the swamps. The film, set during the early days of television, became a staple of the era, shown so frequently that it became almost too familiar to viewers. The repetitive airing of this particular movie created a unique household tradition for many families. Whenever Dad would inquire, ""What's on TV tonight?"" and we'd respond with the inevitable, ""Strangler of the Swamp,"" it would lead to an amusing and predictable outcome. Without fail, he'd decide that the best course of action was to pack us all off to the movies. This recurring scenario meant that we ended up going to the movies quite a lot in those days! The familiarity of ""Strangler of the Swamp"" on our television screens was both a source of mild exasperation and a reason for us to indulge in the cinematic experiences of the time."
"OK, so this film is well acted. It has good direction but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years. The straight man ""deciding to be gay"" and the gay man ""Deciding to be straight"" I did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes, after that i got really offended. As what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles. The leads are played by handsome men but don't let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling unfulfilled. All the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not. Unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our homos.",0,760,False,35907,"Certainly, here's a longer version of your review:

OK, so this film is undeniably well-acted. Each performance is delivered with a level of skill and nuance that captures the complexities of the characters, bringing them to life in a way that is both engaging and believable. The direction is also commendable, with a keen eye for detail that enhances every scene, making it visually compelling and emotionally resonant. However, the simple fact remains that this film undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been tirelessly fighting for over the years. It presents the troubling narrative of a straight man ""deciding to be gay"" and, conversely, a gay man ""deciding to be straight."" This concept is problematic and dismissive of the genuine struggles and experiences of the LGBTQ+ community. 

I did enjoy the film up until the last 20 minutes. The storytelling was engaging, and the character development up to that point was promising. Yet, after that, I found myself getting really offended. The film takes a turn that feels like a betrayal to the audience, particularly those who hoped for a narrative that respects and dignifies the LGBTQ+ experience. As is often the case in these types of films, the straight actors are cast in the main roles, while the out gay actors are relegated to secondary straight roles. This casting choice feels like a missed opportunity to showcase authentic representation on screen.

The leads are indeed played by handsome men, and their charm is undeniable, but don't let that distract you from the core issue: this is a film that ultimately leaves you feeling unfulfilled. It sets up expectations for romance and relationships that many viewers hope will blossom, only to dash those hopes in favor of a narrative that feels regressive and disheartening. Unless you are a priest, that is, in which case, god bless straight women who cure our homos. This film could have been a beautiful exploration of love and identity, but instead, it clings to outdated tropes that do a disservice to its audience."

So I went to ""Beyond Rangoon"" with big expectations. I had been eagerly anticipating this film, hoping it would showcase the same brilliance and depth that I had come to associate with Boorman's previous works. His ability to craft compelling narratives and memorable characters had always drawn me in, and I expected nothing less from this movie. However, my experience with ""Beyond Rangoon"" was far from what I had hoped for.

The film felt like watching a dumb, cheap Chuck Norris jungle movie with all the action scenes cut out. It lacked the engaging plot and thoughtful character development that I had anticipated. Even the soundtrack was very annoying, failing to enhance the scenes or add any emotional depth to the story. Instead of complementing the narrative, it seemed to distract from it, making it even harder to connect with the film. The music, rather than drawing viewers in, seemed to push them further away, creating an additional barrier to enjoying the film.

I can't believe that John Boorman was the director because this movie was so badly done. I think the Burmese people deserve better films to illustrate their struggle. Their history and experiences are rich with stories that deserve thoughtful and respectful representation on the big screen. Unfortunately, ""Beyond Rangoon"" did not do justice to their narrative. The film missed an opportunity to shed light on important issues, instead delivering a disjointed and unsatisfying portrayal. It's disappointing to see such potential wasted, especially when it comes from a director whose previous work has been so impactful."

Even though there is a seemingly pointless aspect to the film, it is undeniably well-acted, which makes it all the more captivating. The performances of Gérard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere are particularly enjoyable and stand out as highlights of the movie. They have an exceptional chemistry together that brings their characters to life in an unforgettable way. Miou-Miou, on the other hand, makes a pink fur look absolutely breathtaking, adding a unique flair to the visual appeal of the film. 

A movie like this probably wouldn't be made in these politically correct times, at least not in the United States, since it seems to sensationalize things like violence, robbery, and casual sex. These themes are presented in a manner that might be considered controversial by today's standards, yet they contribute to the film's raw and authentic feel. This movie proves that with a talented cast and equally talented directing, a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject. The director's vision, coupled with the actors' remarkable performances, creates a cinematic experience that transcends its controversial themes.

It saddened me to find out that Patrick Dewaere committed suicide, a tragic end for such a gifted actor whose contributions to cinema were cut short. In the near future, I will make it a point to check him out alongside Depardieu and Miou-Miou in ""Get Out Your Handkerchief,"" another film that showcases their undeniable talents. It’s important to remember and appreciate the work of actors like Dewaere, who have left a lasting impact on the film industry. Through their performances, they continue to live on and inspire audiences around the world."

"The Finnish version of Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"", set in the small rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disillusionment, hopelessness and death.

The other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity. Particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the ""routines"" of the hospital crew (despite the signs of occasional empathy).

Each episode unfolds with a unique perspective, painting a vivid tapestry of life's complexities and intricacies. The narrative weaves together various stories, each touching upon the universal themes that resonate deeply with the audience. Among the many compelling episodes, I was particularly impressed by two that stood out for their emotional depth and resonance.

The first is the touching story of a young waitress who is filled with an infectious and overwhelming joy of love and life. She brings a vibrant energy to her workplace, trying tirelessly to stir up a romance among her co-workers. Her enthusiasm and zest for life are palpable, and she radiates a sense of optimism that is both refreshing and inspiring. Her character embodies a spirit that is both hopeful and endearing, reminding us of the simple yet profound power of love and human connection. Her story is a testament to the enduring hope and joy that love can bring, even in the most mundane of settings.

The other episode that left a lasting impression on me presents the poignant tale of an old man dying in a hospital, with his devoted wife by his side, trying fervently to help him die with dignity. Their journey is marked by a profound sense of love and resilience as they navigate the challenges posed by the hospital's often impersonal and humiliating practices. Despite the occasional signs of empathy from the hospital staff, the couple's struggle against loneliness and the cold routines of the hospital is heart-wrenching. The stark contrast between the couple's intimate struggle and the detached routines of the hospital crew highlights the universal quest for dignity and respect in the face of mortality.

The film, when compared with Altman's classic, may appear less professional in its execution, but it is undeniably a great piece of art. It captures the essence of human experience with a raw and unfiltered honesty that is both moving and thought-provoking. The Finnish version of ""Short Cuts"" offers a unique and compelling perspective on life, artfully exploring the intricate tapestry of human emotions and experiences. It is a film that resonates deeply, leaving a lasting impact on its audience, and reminding us of the timeless truths of life, love, and the human condition."

Whether you're a longtime fan of the Stooges or new to their work, ""Men in Black"" is a perfect example of why they remain beloved figures in the world of comedy."
"When a movie called Hell Ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché. With character names like ""Pistolero"", ""Comanche"" and ""The Gent"" I braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that. The dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. Dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while ""CC Rider"" plays and they talk about sex and violence. Yawn! The three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable. Seeing old men like Bishop and Madsen (in a freaking ruffled shirt) riding down a dusty strip of desert highway reminded me of two men trying desperately to relive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour tried his best but with such poor material it got lost. Even an appearance by Dennis Hopper in full Easy Rider swing, couldn't save it. And let's talk about the store bought tans shall we? Many have compared this to Tarantino's work. It is not even close. What makes Tarantino's work so brilliant is he knows it's over the top so he just goes balls out and takes it as far over the top as possible.

"I wish I had something more positive to say about Devil Fish, but I honestly can't seem to come up with much. I can't even come up with many of those ""so bad, it's good"" kind of moments. Devil Fish is just plain old bad. The plot is completely derivative (Jaws, anyone?), the acting is wooden, the characters are uninteresting, the special effects are beyond bad, and the score is annoying. Add to that the seemingly inept direction of Lamberto Bava and you've got one stinker of a movie. I think, however, that the film's biggest sin is its lack of a budget. It doesn't appear that Bava had much to work with. By 1984, the Italian film industry was in full decline  especially as far as genre films go. The funding available to Bava was most probably very meager. Film's like Devil Fish that rely on special effects just never had a chance to be good. It's not the only Italian film to suffer this fate. There are a number of Italian movies made in the mid-80s whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what anyone could realistically have expected given their budgetary limitations. <br /><br />However, having said all that and noting the film's many weaknesses, I can't bring myself to rate Devil Fish lower than a 3/10. I've even considered rating it higher but can't because I realize how bad a movie it is. Why don't I rate it lower? Well that's hard to explain.

"RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece.

"William Shakespeare's plays are classified as comedy, tragedy, or history. Some of his most memorable --and most often read -- creations provide us with wistful humor, gentle poetry and hilarious slapstick. Some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of compelling depth and gravity. Regardless, he was able to write with unparalleled skill and inventiveness, contributing greatly to our young language. So in what category lies The Merchant of Venice ? I was very surprised to find it is one of Shakespeare's comedies. I had never before read it nor seen it, but after watching this most recent film version I have decided it is neither and it is both. This is one of many questions the viewer must try to answer when coming to terms with what is clearly a perplexing and deeply troubling moral tragedy.<br /><br />The players are introduced quickly, and simply. One of them, firstly, is Venice itself; director Michael Radford filmed the Venetian scenes in the actual city, creating an impressively vibrant, bustling backdrop to the play's proceedings. To this scenery enters the youthful Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), returning to Venice to see a dear old friend, Antonio (Jeremy Irons). It seems the poor Bassanio has heard of a princess whose father has died and has left to any potential suitors a lottery of sorts. Waiting at the fair lady's island estate are three small trunks, <br /><br />only one of which contains ""images of the princess"". He who can guess the right one, using only blind intuition and the cryptic teasers written upon them, will be bestowed the father's huge fortune for life. Oh, and his daughter and her eternal love in marriage, I forgot to mention. Here the light comedy of Shakespeare takes over the movie. This farcical plot element drives the story and also fills up much of the film's screen time, as a number of painfully eager opportunists arrive at the island, humorously vying for and failing to earn this very wealthy hand in marriage. But before any of this occurs Bassanio, very much lacking in finances, entreats Antonio to loan him three thousand ducats to pay for the lengthy journey he must take to have his shot at the prize. <br /><br />Antonio, himself nearly penniless, must reluctantly embrace humility by seeking the financial aid of Shylock (Al Pacino), one of countless Jewish usurers who keep the sagging economy afloat yet are scorned and persecuted to no end by the city's zealously Christian majority. Thus they dwell in society's underbelly, and it is here the two borrowers must go. Shylock does not hesitate to remind the two men of a certain incident where Antonio insulted and spat on him in the city market, and he proudly rebukes this man who frankly has a lot of nerve now coming to ask for help. But help him Shylock does. He even erases any kind of interest on the loan, most likely feeling he has no reason to be concerned if Antonio will be able to repay him within three months. Still, Shylock's one contractual demand is a pound of Antonio's flesh, should he renege on their agreement. This is an unsettling request, to be sure, for Antonio and Bassanio as well as for us. But it appears that despite his justifiable pride Shylock does not really anticipate seeing such a gruesome act occurring. <br /><br />So here the dramatic groundwork has been laid. And while the film goes off to explore its gentler side with its love lottery and mistaken identities, there still looms the gloomy prospect of the loan itself. In the end, what will become of this ominous agreement? Meanwhile we are left at turns to explore the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has ample dramatic weight to carry here, and he does so with convincing grit and passion. There are times when he is given room for the theatrics we have come to expect from such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are the ones where he internalizes this energy, showing a conflicted personality: honest, sincere, and proud, yet brooding, vengeful and entirely remorseless. This is one of Pacino's most heartfelt performances to date. And while the rest of the cast play their roles creditably and convincingly, it is Pacino who really owns the film -- especially toward the end, when Shakespeare upends this seeming romantic comedy with a wallop of a third act.<br /><br />I shall not reveal much here; all I can say is that it involves the initial loan -- a mighty shoe one expected would drop sooner or later. And does it ever. By the end Shakespeare has raised a host of dilemmas for his audience: seemingly unresolvable questions of faith, morality, law, and mercy are thrown before us through the final scenes, and while by curtain's close the playwright's position may seem clear to some, we are left completely at odds. There are winners and losers in this one, but have the winners earned their spoils with good reason, or have they in a larger sense ended out losing as well? Has virtue been rewarded, or simply flouted? Has justice in fact this time been just? By the play's finish some fates are painfully clear, and unequivocally sealed. But the audience are to be the ones who really decide the verdict for all of those involved. And for some the verdict is still out for the play as well. Comedy or tragedy? The author has cunningly veiled the intense courtroom finale with an ending of light mirth and pat romantic resolutions. Is he saying that all is well that ends well, or is this his final, ironic condemnation? The play's humor serves to set us up nicely for such a heavy crash.

"The first part, Che in Cuba, is about that portion of his life.

This results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very minor role). While del Toro's terrific, think of ""Lawrence"" with Peter O'Toole as the only discernible character: no Alec Guinness, no Omar Sharif, no Anthony Quinn, etc. You get the idea.<br /><br />Because the other characters are interchangeable, this results in a loss of reference. When top aides of Che are killed, you feel no remorse since you don't know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I don't think that's a spoiler), there's no empathy from the audience -- he's just killed.<br /><br />He's too one-dimensional to relate to as a human being.

The documentary presents itself as a cinematic journey, yet it misses the mark in providing a new or enriched perspective beyond the stills that many fans, including myself, have already seen and appreciated in the book. It may be worth watching for those who are new to Burtynsky's work, but for those who have spent time immersed in his photography, the film might not offer much more than what they have already experienced through his printed work. Given this, I would suggest that if you own the book or are familiar with his work, you might be better off skipping this one and perhaps revisiting the book itself to relive the impact of his photography in a format that feels more intimate and impactful."

So, if you're in the mood for a fun, easygoing film with some good laughs, this might just be the right pick for you."

"Wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller, the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes. The acting is good, the characters act like a normal family.

"Years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the movie was first class, the acting memorable and the storyline a classic. Recently I bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1 again I looked eagerly to viewing Part 2...... I was so pleased to realize early on into Part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great Godfather movie, again everything was just about perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG!, I wish I'd stopped at II. The storyline was not good, it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story, the characters were weak especially the daughter. Pacino's protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes such as, Corleone being invested with all the trappings of the Catholic Church with full choir, the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset, the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting (where the 'goodies' get away and everyone else is shot),daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board, the pathetic shooting on the steps ..... Corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and guile isn't ready for an emergency?)...

It's unfortunate because the story of the U.S.S Mason is incredibly important and deserves to be told with the dignity and respect that these men earned. I strongly encourage anyone interested in this piece of history to read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve and provide a far more accurate and compelling account of their experiences. The film, unfortunately, falls short in every way possible and does not do justice to the bravery and legacy of the crew."

Amy Heckerling has a flair for directing comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking) but here it looks like she told the actors to go out and have fun, embracing the whimsical and carefree nature of the film. Micheal Keaton breezes through the role of Johnny, easily delivering his best screen performance to date. His charisma and comedic timing are impeccable, making Johnny a memorable and endearing character. Joe Piscopo is great as the appropriately named Danny Vermin, showcasing his talent for physical comedy and witty dialogue, and it's truly a shame that directors didn't pick up on this potential sooner. And I haven't even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie and the character's unique vocabulary. The creative choice to infuse the character with such a distinctive way of speaking adds an extra layer of humor, and I don't think it's an accident that the bulk of the character's name is spelled MORON, hinting at the satirical nature of his persona.

Good lines are sprinkled throughout the movie, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne, Maurren Stapleton, and Merilu Henner all given good lines that they deliver with perfect comedic timing. Their performances add depth and richness to the film's comedic landscape, ensuring that every scene is filled with laughter and entertainment. Even actors with minor roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get in some good lines, proving that every character, no matter how small, contributes to the overall hilarity of the film. The attention to detail in the script and the performances of the entire cast make this movie a delightful experience from start to finish.

I wholeheartedly recommend it to a friend, confident that they will appreciate the humor, the performances, and the overall joy that this film brings. It's a comedy that stands the test of time, with its clever writing, talented cast, and the unmistakable touch of Amy Heckerling's direction. Whether you're in the mood for a lighthearted comedy or simply want to enjoy the brilliance of Michael Keaton and the ensemble cast, this movie is a must-watch that will leave you with a smile on your face."

This surprisingly well-directed film (especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests) is distinguished by an overall atmosphere of perversity, nastiness, and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence. The film manages to delve deep into the dark underbelly of a seemingly quaint and quiet village, exposing the raw and unsettling truths that lie beneath the surface. The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms; their portrayal adds an additional layer of discomfort and moral complexity to the narrative. Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) really has to be seen to be believed, as it challenges the boundaries of propriety and viewer expectations, further deepening the film's provocative nature. Highly recommended—especially in pair with my other cult favorite ""House with the Windows That Laugh"" (1976). Together, these films offer a chilling exploration of human depravity and the macabre, making for an unforgettable viewing experience that is sure to linger in the minds of its audience long after the credits roll."

"I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness.

"The story of this film is truly remarkable. A virus cut loose and only 1% of the human race survived. The only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say, ""The Twelve Monkeys did it."" Thats right, the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 Billion people. Apparently animals do not contract this disease. Day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this; how it was created; if nature did it or a mere human being had created it. All they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them, the deaths began during 1996-1997, and twelve monkeys have something to do with it. (Or at least thats what the poster says.) So a current convict named James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent as a ""volunteer"" to get some samples from above. After he does his ""volunteer"" work, he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world. Cole accepts and the story of the Twelve Monkeys begin.<br /><br />Throughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times, from 1990, to some time during the 1950's. (In a middle of a war.) Throughout the time traveling back and forth, it starts to mess James up in the head and that twist the story up. The whole story is very well done and I would of gave it a higher grade if it wasn't for the ending. I personally didn't like the ending of the movie and I was very disappointed. I just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen, but it isn't everyone who thinks this way. So I gave it a 8, but if everyone had the same opinion as me I would give it a 6 or 7.<br /><br />For the whole acting of the film, I give it a A+. Bruce Willis is great for this role and he acts good, but Brad Pitt is completely 100% excellent. His acting is so great, he gets into the character so well. I never really cared for Brad Pitt in till I saw him in this and Fight Club. There characters or similar in this film, he is just a little more... insane in this film.

"From actor and independent writer/director John Cassavetes, A Woman Under the Influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability. The husband, Nick (played by Peter Falk) is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife, Mabel (played by Gena Rowlands) the amount of attention that she deserves. From the onset of the film, it is obvious that Mabel is very quirky and strange, but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that. Crazy. Bonkers. Out of her damn mind. Nick tries his hardest to hide this from his co-workers, and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner, he asks her if she'll be okay, as if he's trying to deny Mabel's illness. Her problem only spirals from there.<br /><br />I did find some particular problems with this film. I guess these problems were mostly present in the story, and the way some of the character acted toward the end. Mabel has been committed, because, frankly, she's nuts. Then, six months later, she's ready to come out of the hospital, and her husband throws a party to welcome her back. He never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie. Why would he invite all these people, some of them strangers to Mabel, over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state? It's simply idiotic. Later, after Mabel comes in the house, Mabel's father has a huge outburst at Nick, screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti. His daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation, and the thing you want to do is keep her calm, and he goes nuts over spaghetti? A few minutes later in the film, Nick brings Mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable; make her weird noises and gestures. Didn't he send her there to make her better and not do those things? There were various other parts that occurred after this, but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail. I guess I just had a serious problem with the decision by Cassavetes to have his characters act in this way. It simply didn't make sense.<br /><br />However, although I had problems with the ending of the film, there was one aspect that really redeemed it; the acting. Gena Rowlands played an amazing crazy woman. There were times when I forgot she was acting, where I got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that I was actually scared of her. She was amazingly convincing and intense. However, I was also impressed by the rest of Mabel's family. Peter Falk played a very strange character, and I almost thought he was crazy himself, because of the awkward way he handled his children, his job, and especially the situation with his wife. I also usually don't appreciate child actors. But the young people who played Nick and Mabel's children in this film were phenomenal. It really felt like they were Mabel's children, because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem. I think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together, and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intense.<br /><br />In general I wasn't impressed by this film. The story was jumbled and unclear, and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who wasn't insane in the movie. The only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the Longhetti family. Their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together, and are probably the only reason the film has ever amounted to anything.",0,3583,True,9951,"From actor and independent writer/director John Cassavetes, A Woman Under the Influence offers a glimpse into a working-class family grappling with mental instability.

Nick tries to hide this from his co-workers, and after a strange dinner incident, he asks if she'll be okay, as if denying her illness. Her problem only worsens.

I found issues with the story, particularly with character actions toward the end.

Mabel's father later erupts over spaghetti, which seems counterproductive to keeping her calm. Nick then forces Mabel to repeat unstable behaviors in the stairwell. Didn't he want her better? These decisions by Cassavetes made no sense.

Yet, the acting redeemed the film. Gena Rowlands was phenomenal as the crazy woman, so convincing that I was genuinely scared. Peter Falk played a peculiar character, almost appearing crazy himself. Surprisingly, the child actors were exceptional, portraying a believable attachment to Mabel, which added realism and intensity.

Overall, I wasn't impressed. The story was unclear and characters' actions baffling. The Longhetti family's brilliant acting was the film's saving grace, providing realistic dialogue and powerful performances, likely the only reason the film has any standing."

"""Lifeforce"" is a truly bizarre adaptation of the novel ""The Space Vampires"" by Colin Wilson, scripted by Dan O'Bannon & Don Jakoby. A joint American-British space exploration team makes a mind-boggling discovery: an alien spacecraft resting inside Halleys' Comet, containing three entities that look like people, one of them a female beauty (the oh-so-alluring Mathilda May).<br /><br />They take these discoveries back on board their own spacecraft. Big mistake.<br /><br />It turns out that these creatures drain the life out of human beings, and as American colonel Carlsen (an intense, edgy, and committed Steve Railsback) and British S.A.S. colonel Caine (a solid Peter Firth) watch in horror, an infestation of vampirism overtakes London, with the fate of Earth in the balance.<br /><br />This picture certainly is not lacking in imagination. It moves a little slowly at times but offers so many strange and fanciful ideas and eye-popping visuals that it's hard not to be amused. The first of director Tobe Hoopers' three-picture deal with Cannon Films (he followed it up with ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre II"" and the ""Invaders from Mars"" remake), he makes it something truly unique. Incorporating elements of sci-fi, vampire films, zombie films, and end-of-the-world sagas, it's like nothing that I've seen before.<br /><br />Railsback and Firth are ably supported by such strong Brit actors as Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Aubrey Morris, and John Hallam. Mathilda May is very memorable as the bewitching, enigmatic villainess; it certainly doesn't hurt that she performs a great deal of her scenes in the nude. Also worth noting is a stirring music score from none other than ""Pink Panther"" composer Henry Mancini.<br /><br />Ridiculous it may be, but I found it to be fun as well.

"how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with *that* accent? It's absurd. Apart from that, the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky, the plot is a shallow, boring, confused gangster-movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused.

What have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then?<br /><br />Terrible choice in casting, a convoluted, messy plot and a headache-inducing directorial style. 1/5.",0,817,False,2996,"How can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story seriously with *that* accent? It's absurd. It completely takes you out of the narrative and makes the character feel more like a caricature than a real person. Apart from that glaring issue, the visual style of the director is nauseating and gimmicky, as if they are trying too hard to be edgy or artistic without any substantial reason behind it. The plot itself is a shallow, boring, confused gangster-movie rehash that fails to bring anything new or interesting to the table. It's as if they took elements from various gangster films, mixed them together without any coherent thought, and hoped for the best. The acting is unconvincing, with performances that lack depth and fail to make any emotional impact. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film, which adds to the confusion and makes it difficult to connect with or care about any of them. It's told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused, rather than to enhance the storytelling. This approach makes it hard to follow and ultimately frustrating. On top of this, the film even shows you THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY HAPPEN and then later says ""that didn't really happen, this happened"" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies'. This kind of narrative trickery feels cheap and unnecessary. What have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then? It serves no purpose other than to confuse and irritate the audience.

The casting choices are terrible, with actors who seem mismatched for their roles and unable to bring the characters to life in a believable way. The convoluted, messy plot makes it hard to engage with the story, and the headache-inducing directorial style only adds to the overall unpleasant experience. It's a film that tries too hard to be clever and ends up being a disjointed and unsatisfying watch. There's no clear direction or vision, leaving the viewer feeling disconnected and uninterested. The director's attempt to create a unique visual style falls flat, coming off as more of a distraction than an enhancement to the film. The constant introduction of new characters dilutes the impact of the story, making it feel overcrowded and chaotic. The fragmented flashbacks do not serve the narrative well, instead creating a jumbled mess that detracts from any potential emotional resonance. The entire film feels like a missed opportunity, with potential that is squandered by poor execution. 1/5."
"Loved the movie. I even liked most of the actors in it. But, for me Ms. Davis' very poor attempt at an accent, and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch.

"Found this film for one dollar ($1.00) and the film was a complete waste of time.

However, the plot takes a turn when Mark decides to join the opposite side after witnessing some horrible tortures that were inflicted on both women and men. The film attempts to build tension, but it fails miserably.

One particularly memorable scene, for all the wrong reasons, occurs when Mark is having a drink in a hotel bar. As he sips his drink, his eyes catch the glimpse of the sexy long legs of Sandra Spencer, played by Shannon Tweed, who you might recognize from ""Dead Sexy,"" released in '01. The film attempts to create chemistry between Mark and Sandra, suggesting that they have the extreme hots for each other. In a bizarre twist, they even make passionate love on some very hard rocks, foregoing the comforts of a bed entirely. This scene, much like the rest of the film, is poorly executed and utterly unconvincing.

Overall, this is a horrible film and not worth wasting the time to even look at it. Despite the low price, the film fails to deliver any entertainment value or redeeming qualities. Save yourself the time and energy, and avoid this film at all costs."

"The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff. There's really no reason to compare the two, except maybe for the similar scenery in the final showdown.<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way I'll go into why The Flock is very interesting in some respects. Mostly it's a drama piece rather than a full blown thriller about a very vigilant social worker who monitors sexual offenders. At the very beginning you can clearly see his work has got the better of him. Evident in two scenes where first he's interviewing an offender and slaps him around and second when a woman tries to pick him up and all he can think of are his standard questions from his questionnaire.<br /><br />Gere is very good as Errol Babbage, the aforementioned social worker. His way of performing his job is not unlike that of a police officer, he carries a gun and is constantly checking newspapers and supplies law officials with information if some of his ""flock"" may be responsible for a sexual crime. He's also a person who's lost all happiness of living and his only relief seems to come from exacting his own vigilante justice on his flock. Twice you see him smile, once when he's apologizing for treating his partner rudely and the other after he's beaten up a member of his flock.<br /><br />As a suspense flick, The Flock isn't as successful. Somewhat confusing and with some irritating plot holes but it does have a number of striking set pieces.<br /><br />Overall The Flock is a solid drama about a man performing a dehumanizing job and in the end he has to work hard to keep from being swallowed by the abyss he's surrounded himself in. The world we live in is a pretty sick place and the further one can distance himself from the worst the happier that person is. The Flock gets that point across nicely.",1,1806,True,17649,"The Flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser ""Se7en"" ripoff, with no real reason for comparison except maybe the similar scenery in the final showdown.

Now that that's out of the way, let's explore why The Flock is interesting. Mostly it's a drama rather than a full-blown thriller about a vigilant social worker who monitors sexual offenders. From the start, it's clear his work has consumed him, as seen when he slaps an offender around and when a woman tries to pick him up, only for him to think of his standard questionnaire.

Gere is very good as Errol Babbage, the social worker. His job performance resembles that of a police officer; he carries a gun, constantly checks newspapers, and supplies law officials with information if his ""flock"" may be responsible for a crime. He's lost all happiness and finds relief in exacting vigilante justice. He smiles only twice: once when apologizing to his partner and once after beating up a flock member.

As a suspense flick, The Flock is less successful, with some confusion and plot holes, but it has striking set pieces.

Overall, The Flock is a solid drama about a man doing a dehumanizing job, trying hard not to be swallowed by the abyss around him. It effectively conveys that distancing oneself from the worst in the world leads to happiness. The Flock gets that point across nicely."
"It's too kind to call this a ""fictionalized"" account of the Barker gang. They got the names right, but that's about it.<br /><br />Russell is still hot, I'll grant you that, but this is not the real Ma Barker, who basically took care of the boys by cooking and assisting when they moved around the country, not by planning or participating in the crimes.

The Barker/Karpis victims were a combination of the innocent and of the law-enforcement agents who pursued them, but they definitely did not mow down half-a-dozen FBI agents every time they were cornered.

They were not the well-trained agents that we picture today.) <br /><br />But the worst sin of all is that the movie is basically a bore. Nobody changes, nobody grows.

"Expectations were somewhat high for me when I went to see this movie, after all I thought Steve Carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like Anchorman, The 40 Year-Old Virgin, and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />I'll start with what is right with this movie: at certain points Steve Carell is allowed to be Steve Carell. There are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh, and it's due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle-room to do his thing. He's an undoubtedly talented individual, and it's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total train-wreck.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I'll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong.<br /><br />The film begins with Dan Burns, a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column.

"The music of Albeniz pervades this film. Once and a while it is played with original instrumentation (e.g. piano, but never full orchestra), but often it is re-worked with various contemporary ensembles (e.g.guitar) and treatments (e.g. jazz piano). Only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film: the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances, often flamenco, but not always.

"ONCE UPON A TIME, there were different types of movies. These different movies coexisted even though each one had something different to offer....<br /><br />This seems obvious at first, but I thought I'd point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten. This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. That's all it is. It doesn't claim to be anything else or anything grander. People who deride it as something that fell short of a promise aren't seeing the whole picture- literally. After all, Hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people (Bodyguard or The Preacher's Wife w/Whitney Houston are 2 examples that spring to mind.)<br /><br />First I'd like to address the movie as a vehicle for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world-- and worse movies. The singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun. The movie starts with Schubert's Ave Maria and then Leoncavallo's Matinatta. Pav sings arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut, and Turandot but also sings popular music such as ""I left my heart in San Francisco"" and the song that was nominated for an Oscar & Golden Globe, ""If we were in Love"" w/music by John Williams & lyrics by Alan & Marilyn Bergman- all 3 previous Oscar winners.<br /><br />The story isn't that bad. It was built for Pavarotti so of course it's not going to be something that's profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer. It's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago. When asked to sing again at the same place, the ""MET"" in NYC, he loses his voice from fear. Doctor Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian:)) played by Kathryn Harrold- gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction. He offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly accepts.<br /><br />They embark on an affair, she knowing he's married & promising not to fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman. Despite all that, they fall in love (thus the song, ""IF we were in love"") and with her help, he overcomes his fear & goes back to the MET where he triumphs. I won't tell how it ends, but it's fairly predictable. Which isn't always a bad thing. <br /><br />The performances in this aren't that bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) isn't an actor, so if you're expecting a Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks performance, YOU are deluded, not Pavarotti. He knows he's not a thespian. What he is is cute, charming & charismatic. He is having fun himself, and if you can just let yourself have fun too, it's not so bad. One funny line is when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that she's a ""thirsty plant, Fini can water you!"" and of course, she says, ""I don't want to be watered on by Fini!"" Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semi-uptight woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little. One of my favorite lines in the movie is: ""Life never has to be life size."" And there's Eddie Albert who does his usual good job as Fini's manager. There are several ""themselves"" cameos by real conductors, singers, etc. and it is filmed on location at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center. <br /><br />If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti, or if you can just let yourself go & enjoy a ""little fling"" just like he proposes in the movie- then you can enjoy this movie for what it is. I know I do- EVERY time. :)<br /><br />",1,3421,True,22332,"Once upon a time, different types of movies coexisted, each offering something unique. This simple truth seems forgotten by some, so let me remind you: this is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. It doesn't claim to be anything grander. Critics who say it falls short miss the point. Hollywood often makes movies as star vehicles (think Bodyguard or The Preacher's Wife with Whitney Houston).

As a vehicle for Pavarotti, it’s enjoyable. The singing is fabulous, featuring arias like Schubert's Ave Maria, Leoncavallo's Matinatta, and popular songs like ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco."" The Oscar-nominated ""If We Were in Love"" with music by John Williams is a highlight.

The plot, tailored for Pavarotti, isn't profound but serves its purpose. It follows a famous opera singer traumatized by a past performance. When asked to sing at the MET in NYC, he loses his voice from fear. Dr. Pamela, played by Kathryn Harrold, cures his psychosomatic reaction. They embark on an affair, both knowing the risks, and fall in love. With her help, he triumphs at the MET. The ending is predictable, but that's not always bad.

Performances aren't terrible. Pavarotti, playing Giorgio Fini, isn't an actor, so don't expect a Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks performance. He's charming and charismatic, clearly having fun. A funny line is when he tells Pamela she's a ""thirsty plant, Fini can water you!"" to which she replies, ""I don't want to be watered on by Fini!"" Harrold is sweet as she learns to live a little. A favorite line: ""Life never has to be life size."" Eddie Albert shines as Fini's manager. Cameos by real conductors and singers add authenticity, and it’s filmed on location at the Metropolitan Opera.

If you like opera, Pavarotti, or just want to enjoy a ""little fling"" like he proposes, you can enjoy this movie for what it is. I know I do—every time. :)"
"Of course, all this nonsense begs the question 'Does a genre as self-referential as the teen comedy really need another parody movie?'

"There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to begin. The story is not cohesive AT ALL. I guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his/her head in confusion.<br /><br />Here's what I remember of the movie before I was bored into unconsciousness: A quasi-abusive dad chases some pre-teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all. In the next scene, the girls are about 15. They're driving with their parents and hit a deer. The deer must have been explosive because their car blows up, one sister drags the other from the burning wreckage. Then, the girls are drifting in a boat on a lake and make a huge plan to go to Kentucky (??) and start a new life. In the very next scene, the girls are hitchhiking toward a military base. And what a military base it is. Actually, it's more like a hog farm converted to look like a military base with plenty of confused extras playing ""soldiers."" The base commander's office is particularly awesome because there are random things like an AK-47 hanging on the wall and a drill sergeant hat mounted to a plaque (????) so the audience is sure to know that this is a military guy's office. Then some random dude pushing a motorcycle shows up and the base commander orders him to go ""into town"" to buy some porn mags, and to make sure the soldiers don't think that he's on the ""pink team."" So our character takes a pickup converted to look like an army truck ""to town"" and loads up a box from a nondescript ""book store"" with a blowup doll by the front door. The girls hide in the guy's truck when he stops to gas up, and look through the porn stash to find items inside like the ""anal invader."" I guess that's enough of the plot to scare most people away. Plot aside, the sound quality is terrible and the movie is full of cheesy attempts at symbolism, like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruit during the scene where the ""slutty"" sister meets the main character for the first time, or how the camera lingers way too long on certain shots to try to convey a ""message"".<br /><br />If you ever see this for sale or rent or whatever, stay away.

The film is filled with the usual tropes: detectives, revenge, tycoons, hookers, and S&M, all of which are portrayed in a way that seems to lack any real originality or purpose. It's as if the filmmakers were making it up as they went along, adding elements without consideration for how they fit into the overall story. The film picks up a bit in the second half, offering some moments of intrigue and excitement, but by then, it feels too little, too late. For those looking for a more coherent and entertaining experience, a more decent Lundgren flick to consider would be RED SCORPION instead. It's a more solid choice that better showcases Lundgren's talents without the distraction of a muddled plot."
"Brain of Blood starts as Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley) the leader of a country called Kahlid is close to death because of cancer, however if he dies Kahlid will tear itself apart without anyone to lead them so doctor Robert Nigserian (Grant Williams) & one of Amir's devotees Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) have devised a plan to take Amir's dead body to America where mad scientist Dr. Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) will transplant his brain into a fresh body & with a bit of plastic surgery no-one will ever know he was even dead. Things don't go according to plan though as when the time comes to transplant Amir's brain Trenton's freak assistant Gor (John Bloom) brings a dead body of someone that fell from a balcony, Trenton needed a strong fit living body & since there's no more time he decides to use Gor's body as a temporary stop-gap until another more suitable one can be found. Unfortunately when Amir wakes up in his new body he's not very happy at what he sees, I mean would you be if you found out your brain was inside a badly burned freak?<br /><br />Also known as Brain Damage, The Brain, The Creature's Revenege & The Undying Brain this cheapo exploitation flick was produced & directed by the one & only Al Adamason & quite frankly I'm offended at the pathetic 1.5 rating Brain of Blood has on the IMDb, personally I think it's terrific fun in a so bad it's good sort of way. The highly entertaining script by Kane W. Lynn & Joe Van Rodgers is as loopy & silly as they come from sloppy blood soaked brain transplants to crazed mad scientists, from 7 foot tall acid scarred freaks who play with toy cars to 4 foot tall midget medical assistant's, from basement dungeons to rooftop chases, from car crashes to assassination's, kidnaps to screaming scantily clad women, from Regina Carrol's hair-do which should get it's own mention during the opening credits to teenage girls imprisoned in the basement for blood to a laugh-out-loud hilarious ending which includes some deep meaningful speech! It's all here & Brain of Blood has quality cheese stamped all over it, if your a fan of bad low budget exploitation flicks with a sense of fun then this film should be right at the top of your list of 'must see' films. Despite it's lowly 1.5 rating I am proud to admit that I liked Brain of Blood a lot, I thought it was an absolute hoot to watch, it slows down a bit at the end with a few too many shots of people wandering around doing nothing in particular but until that point it had moved along like a rocket, at only 85 minutes it's relatively short, it's difficult to second guess the barmy plot & I just think it's loads of campy fun.<br /><br />This is director Adamson's masterpiece as far as I'm concerned along with Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971) which he made a year before this. Those who have seen an Adamson film before will know about the none existent production values, cheap special effects & cardboard sets & that all adds to the fun, this film manages that fine between incompetence & seriousness to create a memorable viewing experience. I love the opening shot of Kahlid which is obviously just a photo of the Taj Mahal in India complete with statuesque people in the foreground! Regina Carrol's hair seems to be a separate entity on it's own, it seems to change styles between shots & is frankly horrendous, don't get me started about her make-up job either that she must apply with a a paint sprayer! There is another hilarious moment when we see Amir's body has been transported to America wrapped in what looks like ordinary tin foil, why is the question I asked myself, why!? The effects are variable, there's a terrible looking fake spider, Gor's burned make-up job is pretty bad although there is a surprisingly gory brain removal which is actually quite impressive.<br /><br />The budget for Brain of Blood must have been practically none existent, I must admit I thought Trenton's lab was quite good with various computers & medical instruments although the rest of the film looks cheap & nasty. The production values are low, the music was taken from another film Beast of Blood (1971) & the acting is awful but in a campy fun sort of way.<br /><br />Brain of Blood may have the best title for an exploitation film ever & as far as I'm concerned it's a highly entertaining piece of nonsense that I had a great time watching & laughing at. They just don't/can't/won't make them like this anymore, impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good film but bad movie lovers should enjoy it.

Things go awry when Trenton's assistant Gor (John Bloom) brings a dead body instead of a living one. With no time to spare, Amir's brain is transplanted into Gor's burned body, leaving Amir unhappy with the result.

Also known as ""Brain Damage,"" ""The Brain,"" ""The Creature's Revenge,"" and ""The Undying Brain,"" this exploitation flick by Al Adamson is underrated at a 1.5 IMDb rating. The entertaining script by Kane W. Lynn and Joe Van Rodgers features brain transplants, mad scientists, and acid-scarred freaks. It includes rooftop chases, kidnappings, and a hilarious ending. Despite a slow end, the 85-minute film is campy fun. Adamson's masterpiece, along with ""Dracula vs. Frankenstein"" (1971), shows low production values, cheap effects, and cardboard sets, adding to the experience.

The film's opening shot of Kahlid is clearly a photo of the Taj Mahal. Regina Carrol's ever-changing hairstyle and overdone makeup stand out. Amir's body transported in tin foil raises questions. Effects range from a fake spider to a surprisingly gory brain removal.

With a nonexistent budget, ""Brain of Blood"" has low production values, reused music from ""Beast of Blood"" (1971), and campy acting. It's a highly entertaining piece of nonsense that bad movie lovers will enjoy. Impossible to recommend for a good film, but if you're weird like me, it's a hoot."
"The film shows relations of the dying mother, and the son, who is very attached to her, and definitely loves her. What does it show? It shows their living in very poor conditions. It shows how tenderly they ""walk"" (really he is bringing her). But what do we see further? After their promenade he walks alone at the same places, where they walked together. It is not possible. A person, who love and care about another dying one, would do everything to make the life of this one better. He would not have a free minute to ponder, to be alone with oneself, and if he finds a few minutes a month for that, he would run away from the places where he has usually to be. Another thing. The author devoted this film to Andrey Tarkovsky. We see he learned many Tarkovsky's visual effects. But in Sokurov's film they are only effects, they do not support any senses or mood. Someone has compared this film with ""Mirror"" (""Zerkalo""). There is nothing common except these visual effects.

"So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series, and had just watched parts 1-3, which I thought were ALL excellent.

Suddenly, the puppets are back at Bodega Bay Inn, back in their case (minus Blade), and Toulon for some reason is willing to help his puppets again (he betrays them in part II for his love of Elsa).

It’s a delightful piece of cinema that stands the test of time. If you think Murray is supposed to win an Oscar for his performance and that is the type of movie you are expecting, don't bother because this film isn’t aiming for that kind of acclaim. It was funny when I saw it in 1979, and it hasn't lost its charm over the years. The humor is timeless, and it continues to entertain audiences of all ages. Good clean fun for the kids and mindless entertainment for the older folks make it an ideal choice for family movie night. The story line is simple and easy to follow, ensuring that viewers of all ages can enjoy it without getting lost in complex plots.

Murray has done better in his career, delivering performances that have been critically acclaimed and award-winning, but this is his first film, a fact that showcases his early potential and comedic talent. The movie reminds me of a time when we didn't need blood and guts to be entertained, a refreshing reminder of simpler times in the film industry. Morty is the head dunce and plays the part perfectly, bringing a unique charm to the character that is both endearing and amusing. The other counselors are typical revved up teens looking to have fun during the summer, capturing the essence of youthful exuberance and carefree living.

One nice thing about this movie is it has a message, a subtle yet meaningful takeaway that resonates with audiences even today. It’s a film that combines humor with heart, making it a worthwhile watch for anyone seeking a light-hearted escape. The film stands as a testament to a genre of movies that prioritizes entertainment and enjoyment over complex storytelling or dramatic depth. It's a nostalgic trip back to a time when movies were made to make people laugh and feel good, a purpose it fulfills effortlessly."

I can't help but wonder if the reason for its scarcity is because it had low ratings, or perhaps there were complaints from the Bakersfield PD themselves.

Regardless of the reason, it's one of those rare comedies that I would absolutely love to see again, but it feels almost impossible to track down. I've heard whispers that it is being, or has been, repeated on another network, but unfortunately, not over here where I am. It's a real shame because it is such an ingenious piece of work. The unique humor and creative storytelling made it truly special, and it's disappointing that more people don't have the opportunity to enjoy it.

"As a fan of history, mythology, and fantasy ""Mystic Knights"" show pulled me in from the get-go.

Also, some of the key players are repeatedly being given dead lines (King Conchobar and Angus for instance) they need to be given something... more. I'm not sure what but the writers should be able to come up with something. ACTING--Apart from some over acting by villagers (horrid lines they end up putting too much effort into), casting did extremely well in choosing their leads and so on. Everyone, good and bad, works well together! COSTUMES/WEAPONS--The everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular! Mystic Knight armor that falls short are Deirdre's and Garrett's. A chainmail bikini would probably have better protection in her case... and wouldn't look as plastic; his looks like bunch of snap-it-together pieces of brown plastic, when it should look bronze.

This is the absolute most sad movie experience I've ever had, and I can't emphasize enough just how disappointing it truly is. It is plain and right AWFUL and should not be sold or rented to anyone. The premise, which might initially catch your interest, quickly unravels into a nonsensical and frustrating viewing experience. If you still think the plot seems intriguing, reflect on this: telephones can move, run and kill people as can also any other electric appliance. The absurdity doesn't stop there; it can throw things at you, haunt you and run after you. It's hard to fathom how such a concept made it past the initial stages of production. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE; it is a disgrace for the horror genre, and I genuinely cannot stress enough how much you should avoid it. The movie fails in delivering any genuine scares or thrills, leaving the audience in disbelief that something so poorly executed was even made. The idea, which might have had potential if handled differently, is instead reduced to a laughable and regrettable mess. Trust me, there are far better ways to spend your time than watching this film; engaging with this cinematic disaster is just not worth it."

"This is an excellent James Bond movie. Although it is not part of the original and more famous series, and it is a standalone film, it is very well done. Enticing Sean Connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius, as was titling the movie in a way that references his past vow to not play Bond again. Connery was as great as he was in his earlier 007 appearances. The script is outstanding, as are the photography and the performances. It's the earliest movie I recall with Kim Basinger, who became much more famous after this film; Barbara Carrera was excellent; and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. The frequent references to the aging of Bond and the changing times and attitudes of the British secret service were most humorous. The 007 gadgets equaled those of the other Bond films. The only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme, which, of course, could not be used by this competing production. It was rather amazing to me to be able to see two excellent James Bond movies released in the same year, this one and Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is an emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The early 80's were the first heyday of such things, and the use of them in this film made it a very contemporary movie.

This is one that I've watched, with pulse quickening every time, at least a dozen times. From the very first viewing, the excitement never wanes, and each subsequent watch brings the same thrill and exhilaration. It's amazing how a film can maintain its entertainment value even after multiple viewings, and this one certainly delivers on that front. The pacing, the storyline, and the sheer energy of the film contribute to its lasting appeal. 

Most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done, and we can recognize them from other work. Those that don't have current name recognition probably don't want it. It's interesting to see how their careers have evolved since then, and some have indeed become recognizable faces in the industry, while others have chosen paths that keep them out of the limelight. Regardless of their current status, their performances in this film were memorable and contributed significantly to its charm. The cast dynamics and chemistry were spot on, making the viewing experience all the more enjoyable.

This was a fun ADVENTURE. Sort of like The Little Rascals if they just had to be serious. The adventurous spirit of the film is infectious, capturing the essence of youthful exploration and the thrill of embarking on a journey filled with unexpected twists and turns. It evokes a sense of nostalgia, reminiscent of childhood escapades and the boundless imagination that comes with it. This film masterfully balances humor and seriousness, much like The Little Rascals, yet it adds its unique twist by requiring the characters to confront challenges with a level of seriousness that adds depth to the narrative. It's this blend of fun and adventure that makes it an enduring favorite, one that continues to captivate and entertain with each viewing."

If you are into snake movies than check out SSSSSSS, but don't torture yourself with this crap.",0,750,False,28683,"A group of tourists find themselves stranded on the infamous Snake Island after an unfortunate accident involving their boat. In a twist of fate, they are compelled to spend the night on the island. As you might have suspected, the island isn't called Snake Island just because it's fun to say—there's a sinister history behind the name. The island has a notorious reputation for people mysteriously disappearing one by one, all thanks to the large and menacing snake population that inhabits it. This unfortunate turn of events is precisely what befalls these poor, naive souls.

Now, let’s talk about the movie itself—it’s a very boring and typical horror flick with a storyline that you've probably seen a hundred times before. It features a plethora of off-screen snake attacks that fail to deliver any real tension or excitement. The performances, too, leave much to be desired, as they are delivered by a cast of NOBODY actors who don’t manage to bring any depth or believability to their roles. Their lackluster portrayals do nothing to elevate the uninspired script.

The only somewhat entertaining scene that stands out in this otherwise dreary film is an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene. However, even this scene feels like it was thrown in just for the sake of it and doesn’t contribute anything meaningful to the plot. It’s quite tame and isn’t anything you couldn't see in a PG-13 rated movie, folks, so don’t expect anything remotely scandalous or provocative.

If you are someone who genuinely enjoys snake movies and are on the lookout for a film that will give you the thrills and chills, then I strongly recommend checking out the classic film SSSSSSS instead. It’s a far superior choice and will likely satisfy your craving for reptilian horror. In contrast, this film is not worth your time or effort, so don’t torture yourself with this mediocre and uninspired piece of cinema. Save yourself the disappointment and look elsewhere for your snake-themed entertainment."

This movie isn't even good for laughs, which is often the last refuge for bad films that can at least be entertainingly terrible. Sadly, this one doesn’t even manage that. The only time I laughed, and I use the term loosely, was when Dante kept saying in a funny voice, ""Nobody can beat Dante, Muhwa hwaa."" It was a moment that was more bewildering than humorous. I said holy god and shut it off at that point, feeling both disappointed and relieved to escape further torture. Bad, bad movie. I can't emphasize enough how utterly unenjoyable this experience was, and I genuinely struggle to find any redeeming quality in it. 2/10"
"because you can put it on fast forward and watch the inane story, without having to listen to banal dialogue, and be finished in 10 minutes max. Come to think of it, even 10 minutes is too much to waste on Enid-Blyton-meets-struggling-wanna-be-artists. Vomit.",0,259,False,9433,"Certainly! Here's an expanded version of your review:

One of the most convenient features of modern streaming platforms is the ability to fast forward through content, allowing viewers to breeze through an entire movie or episode in a fraction of the time it would normally take. This is especially useful when dealing with a film that presents an inane story, lacking in depth or originality. By utilizing the fast forward function, you can quickly skim through the plot and get a general sense of what is happening on screen without subjecting yourself to the tedious, banal dialogue that may accompany it. This way, you can be done with the entire experience in a maximum of 10 minutes. 

However, upon further reflection, even dedicating 10 minutes to such a lackluster piece of work feels like a waste of precious time. The content in question seems to suffer from a severe identity crisis, reminiscent of an Enid Blyton narrative awkwardly colliding with the aspirations of struggling, wanna-be artists who haven't quite found their voice or style. It's a blend that doesn't quite work and leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied and wishing for something more substantive and engaging. In fact, the mere thought of investing any amount of time in this endeavor, no matter how brief, is enough to evoke a strong reaction of distaste. Vomit."

The filmmakers seemed to have aimed for a complex narrative with interwoven storylines, but unfortunately, the execution fell flat, leading to a rather underwhelming experience that failed to captivate or engage the audience. 

The writing was trite, filled with clichés and predictable dialogue, which made the entire experience feel uninspired and lacking in originality. The pace was slow and disjointed, making it difficult to maintain interest as the story unfolded. The narrative meandered without a clear sense of direction, leaving viewers disengaged and uninterested in the outcome. The characters were boring, lacking depth and development, which made it hard to invest in their journeys or care about their fates. 

George Clooney, despite his star power, looks like he needs to get into a gym. His performance seemed tired, as if he was merely going through the motions without any real commitment to the role. Matt Damon hammed it up, overacting to the point where it became distracting rather than compelling. His exaggerated expressions and gestures detracted from the seriousness of the film's themes. The others in the cast seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter, delivering their dialogue with little emotion or conviction, which only added to the overall sense of detachment from the story.

The worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct, and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business, oil, and the Middle-East. By trying to appease everyone, it ultimately failed to make any meaningful statements or provide any insightful commentary on these complex issues. The film shied away from taking risks or presenting bold ideas, resulting in a bland and forgettable experience. I have seen documentaries provide more excitement and depth on these topics, shedding light on real-world issues with far more impact and clarity.

Watch it only if there's absolutely nothing else to do. If you're seeking entertainment or thought-provoking content, you might be better off exploring other options, as this film does little to satisfy either desire. It serves as a reminder that even star-studded casts and ambitious narratives can fall short when the execution lacks creativity and passion."
"Office work, especially in this era of computers, multi-functional copy machines, e-mail, voice mail, snail mail and `temps,' is territory ripe with satirical possibilities, a vein previously tapped in such films as `Clockwatchers' and `Office Space,' and very successfully. This latest addition to the temp/humor pool, however, `Haiku Tunnel,' directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth, fails to live up to it's predecessors, and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door, waiting for a chance to sneak in. Unfortunately for the audience, that chance never comes; so what you get is a nice try, but as the man once said, no cigar.<br /><br />	As the narrator/star of the film, Josh Kornbluth (playing Josh Kornbluth), points out in the opening frames (in a monologue delivered directly into the camera), this story is pure fiction, and takes place in the fictional city of `San Franc'l'isco.' It's an innovative, if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer, and not all that funny. It is, however, a harbinger of what is to follow, all of which-- like the disclaimer-- just isn't all that funny.<br /><br />	Kornbluth plays Kornbluth, an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a `temp.' It's a job that suits him, and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time. But when he goes to work for a lawyer, Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), he does too good a job on the first day, and Shelby dispatches head secretary Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker) to Kornbluth to persuade him to go `perm.' The thought of working full time for the same company, though, initially strikes fear in the heart of Kornbluth, but he caves in and signs on for the position. He's nervous about it, but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence (which, of course, they would never do with a temp), and if things get too rough, he has seventeen important letters he's typed up-- that now just have to be mailed out-- to fall back on (he's been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part, and he needs that `something easy to do' in reserve, in case it all gets to be too much for him). These are `important' letters, however, and by the end of the week, Kornbluth still has them in reserve, on his desk. And it doesn't take a genius to figure out that when Shelby finds out about it, Kornbluth's days as the fair-haired boy are going to be over. And quick.<br /><br />	The Brothers Kornbluth, who not only directed, but along with John Bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film, should have taken a page out of the Ben Stiller Book of Comedy, where it says `If you play it straight, they will laugh.' But, they didn't, and the audience won't. Because in comedy, even looking at it as objectively as possible, when the main character (as well as most of the supporting characters, in this case) `Plays' funny-- as in, he `knows' he's being funny-- he never is. And that's exactly what Kornbluth does here; so rather than being `funny,' he comes across as insincere and pretentious, a grievous error in judgment on the part of the Kornbluths, because by allowing it, they sabotaged their own movie. <br /><br />	In trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn't work, it comes down to two basic reasons: The directing, which-- if not necessarily `bad'-- is at least careless; and secondly, the performances, beginning with that of Josh Kornbluth. Quite simply, Kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here. Unlike Stiller, or even Steve Martin-- both of whom use self-deprecating humor very effectively-- Kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light; he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he, the real Kornbluth, is in reality much more clever than Kornbluth the character. And being unable to get past that does him in, as well as the film. Rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify, Kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach. So what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting, and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with, with an inexplicably narrow focus (given the potential of the rich subject matter), it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly.<br /><br />	The one saving grace of the film is the performance by Warren Keith as Shelby, whose subtle delivery is convincing, and which-- in and of itself-- is fairly humorous. The effectiveness of it is diminished, however, inasmuch as Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth, which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project. <br /><br />	Shumaker and Sarah Overman (Julie Faustino) also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances, which are commendable, if not entirely memorable; they at least make their scenes watchable, and Overman even manages to elevate Kornbluth's performance, if only momentarily. But it's still not enough to save the day or the film.<br /><br />	The supporting cast includes Amy Resnick (Mindy), Brian Thorstenson (Clifford), June Lomena (DaVonne), Joe Bellan (Jimmy the Mail Clerk), with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking Harry Shearer, as the Orientation Leader-- a role that begs for an answer to the question, `What was he thinking when he agreed to this?' In any work environment, there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone's comedic cannon, and the films depicting said situations will always be with us; the good ones (see paragraph one) may even become classics in their own right. `Haiku Tunnel,' however, will doubtfully remain very long amongst them, for it's destiny lies elsewhere-- in a realm known only as: `Obscurity.' I rate this one 1/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br />",0,5992,True,11799,"Office work, especially in this era of computers and multi-functional gadgets, offers ripe satirical possibilities, as seen in films like 'Clockwatchers' and 'Office Space.' However, 'Haiku Tunnel,' directed by Josh and Jacob Kornbluth, doesn't measure up to its predecessors and leaves the humor outside, never really allowing it to enter. The film, narrated by Josh Kornbluth as himself, starts with a fictional disclaimer about 'San Franc'l'isco,' which sets the tone for the lackluster comedy that follows.

Kornbluth plays a temp who becomes a permanent employee for a lawyer, Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), but struggles with sending out seventeen important letters. The Kornbluths' direction misses the mark, and the comedy suffers as a result. Josh Kornbluth's performance appears insincere, as he seems too self-impressed to effectively deliver self-deprecating humor, unlike comedians like Ben Stiller. This disconnect alienates rather than endears him to the audience.

The film falters due to lackluster directing and unconvincing acting, compounded by a weak screenplay with a narrow focus. Warren Keith's performance as Shelby is a highlight, bringing subtle humor despite being overshadowed by Kornbluth. Helen Shumaker and Sarah Overman offer commendable performances, with Overman briefly elevating Kornbluth's scenes.

The supporting cast includes Amy Resnick, Brian Thorstenson, June Lomena, Joe Bellan, and a cameo by Harry Shearer as the Orientation Leader, a puzzling role choice. While office comedies can become classics, 'Haiku Tunnel' is unlikely to join their ranks, destined instead for obscurity. I rate this one 1/10."

It seemed that its creators took elements from the first two films to construct this one. At the risk of giving out spoilers, the basic premise involves Tenchi being kidnapped, prompting the team to mobilize in an effort to rescue him. This setup is nothing new for fans of the series, as similar scenarios have been explored before. The twist here is that a past love of Yosho's emerges as the antagonist, but even this feels repetitive since a similar plot device was utilized in the second movie. 

The ongoing battle between Aeka and Ryoko, which has been a recurring theme throughout the series, is starting to lose its appeal and become quite tedious. It's a dynamic that, while initially engaging, seems to have run its course without offering anything fresh or exciting in this installment. The movie is notably lacking in action scenes, which is surprising given the potential for thrilling sequences that the plot could have allowed. Moreover, the comedy, a staple of the Tenchi Muyo series, is nearly absent, leaving the film feeling somewhat flat and uninspired.

I personally don't know what AIC, its makers, were thinking when they put this movie together. It doesn't seem to capture the vibrant energy or creativity that the Tenchi Muyo series is known for. The lack of action and humor significantly detracts from the overall experience, making it difficult to stay engaged. In light of these shortcomings, I gave this movie a vote of 4."
"In an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious 'space-dust') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars, a young loner, Timmy, finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly), his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie.<br /><br />Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy, whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife, played by the gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!).<br /><br />Timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. With the authorities on Fido's trail, trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies, and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help, will Timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend?<br /><br />A refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick, Fido is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. Taking the Romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town America is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that I have seen.<br /><br />Connelly's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame, along with Day Of The Dead's Bub, and Return Of The Living Dead's Tarman; it is not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse, but The Big Yin's performance is so fine that I actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the cast also give commendable performances, with young K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentionsRay, because, for one so young, he puts in a particularly assured turn, and Moss because she is so bloody yummy!<br /><br />This is the third zombie film that I have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead), and, to my surprise, it is also the best.

The cast shines, especially young K'Sun Ray (Timmy) and Carrie-Anne Moss, who is stunning and talented.

The entire film, up until that point, held so much promise. The characters were engaging, the plot had potential, and the cinematography was quite impressive. There were moments throughout the film where I genuinely felt intrigued, moments where I thought, ""Okay, maybe this will turn out to be something special."" It seemed like the story was heading toward a truly memorable conclusion. The tension was building, the stakes were rising, and I was on the edge of my seat, eagerly anticipating how everything would come together. But then, as the final scenes unfolded, it became glaringly apparent that the filmmakers had no idea how to wrap things up. The promise of a satisfying twist, an unexpected turn, or even a meaningful resolution was completely shattered. Instead, what we got was a conclusion that felt rushed and unimaginative, as if they had thrown in the towel and decided to end it in the most uninspired way possible.

It's baffling to think that after all the effort put into crafting the rest of the film, the ending was treated with such disregard. It's as if they were so focused on building up the story that they forgot they needed to deliver a payoff that matched the buildup. I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment, knowing that this film had the potential to be something memorable, something that would linger in the minds of its audience long after the credits rolled. Instead, it leaves you with a feeling of emptiness, a sense that you invested time and emotion into a story that ultimately went nowhere. I genuinely wish I could sit down with the creative minds behind this film and ask them what they were thinking, how they could let such a promising narrative fizzle out in such a lackluster manner. It truly boggles the mind."

This is quite surprising, given the reputation of the individuals involved and the high expectations that typically accompany their projects. It seems as though the constraints they faced may have impacted the overall quality of the production in a way that was unexpected for both the creators and the audience. 

There ARE some frightening scenes in this Highland mystery (mostly when the ""monster"" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid that I found most of the story unintentionally funny! These moments, intended to evoke fear and tension, sometimes instead prompted laughter, which I'm sure was not the intended reaction. This contrast between the intended horror and the actual humor is quite striking and adds a peculiar charm to the series, albeit unintentionally. Such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: Oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand over there ... hmm this is a bit puzzling ... This scene, meant to be shocking and suspenseful, instead becomes almost comical in its presentation, leaving the viewer in a curious state of amusement rather than fear.

For many years, fans of British cult TV shows campaigned to have this serial released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC always said no. The persistent efforts of these fans speak to the unique place this serial holds in the annals of cult television, despite—or perhaps because of—its flaws. Now I think I understand why! The reluctance of the BBC to release it becomes clearer when one considers the disparity between the intended tone and the actual execution. While the serial undoubtedly has its moments, the overall effect may not align with the high standards typically associated with British TV productions, explaining the hesitancy to make it widely available."
"The brilliant thing about Withnail & I is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all its other finery.

The portrayal lacks depth and nuance, leaving the audience unconvinced and unsympathetic to their plight. The acting in this film is notably bad, with performances that feel forced and lacking in conviction. The cinematography is poorly executed, with shots that are either too dark to see or so poorly framed that they detract from the story. The dialogue is unbelievable, with lines that sound more like they belong in a bad soap opera than a serious film. The use of weaponry in the film is unrealistic, with scenes that defy logic and common sense. The gore, intended to shock and awe, instead looks more like grape jelly than the real thing, making it impossible to take any of the violent scenes seriously.

Already writer-director Preston Sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories, creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations, and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue. Sturges' ability to weave humor with insight demonstrates a creative genius that few filmmakers of his time could match. His work often reflects a deep understanding of human nature, and his clever dialogue is both entertaining and thought-provoking. (No wonder the Coen brothers' next movie is going to be an homage to Sturges.) His influence is evident in the way modern filmmakers approach storytelling, blending comedic elements with serious undertones. Sturges' films remain timeless, with their wit and charm continuing to captivate audiences even today.

The major problem is that the plot's not all the way there yet; it lacks surprise, the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing. This results in a narrative that feels somewhat predictable, as if it follows a formula without the innovation that typically characterizes Sturges' work. The coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon, serving as a weak anchor for the storyline that fails to engage the audience fully. It's a device that seems forced rather than organic, detracting from the overall effectiveness of the film. The ending is thoroughly predictable, leaving viewers with a sense of déjà vu rather than the satisfaction of a well-crafted conclusion. Here, the film falls short of the standard set by Sturges' other works. Frank Capra does this sort of thing much better, with a deftness and emotional resonance that Sturges, in this instance, does not quite achieve.

If you're new to Preston Sturges, check out ""The Lady Eve"" or ""Sullivan's Travels"" or ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" first. These films showcase the director at his best, with narratives that are both engaging and thought-provoking. His ability to create memorable characters and craft stories that resonate with audiences is on full display in these works. If you've seen these already, then go ahead and watch this one. While it may not reach the heights of Sturges' masterpieces, it still offers moments of brilliance and serves as an example of his evolving style and approach to filmmaking. It's worth watching for those who appreciate cinematic history and the development of film as an art form."
"Anna Christie (1931)<br /><br />On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions). Garbo is if anything more commanding (or more beautiful as a screen presence) and her acting is more restrained. And she seems frankly more at ease, probably for a lot of reasons, but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first talking picture, so had adjusted quickly.<br /><br />Without comparing always one film to the other, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill play with too many words. His themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here, but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway. There are some scenes missing--the Coney Island section is shortened and isn't as good--but overall it's a direct echo of the first film. The director, Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French), is simply redoing what was done already, which I assume must be a frustrating experience.<br /><br />It's interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way (not only the sets, but the shots, are all the same). There is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier film--some of the storm, understandably, but also a brief scene where Marie Dressler (from the English language version) is walking with her friend on a plank over a canal, drunk as can be. But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors taking their parts. There is no replacing Dressler, for sure, but for me the German father is more believable and honest in his performance.<br /><br />Clearly the themes--immigration, wayward fathers, daughters turning to prostitution, and the troubles of finding true love--have strong currents back then, especially with European threads (Garbo, appropriately, plays a Swedish young woman).",1,1967,True,24906,"Anna Christie (1931)

This version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a new cast, is more refined than the English version, both being American MGM productions. Garbo appears more commanding and at ease, likely due to no longer making her first talking picture.

Without constant comparisons, this Anna Christie remains O'Neill's play with its wordiness. Themes of a woman's desire for love without sacrificing independence are present but feel dated. Some scenes, like the Coney Island section, are shorter, yet the film echoes the original. Director Jacques Feyder is essentially redoing what was already done, likely a frustrating task.

Watching both films in succession is intriguing as they share identical blocking, sets, and shots. Occasionally, scenes from the earlier film are used, such as the storm and Marie Dressler's silhouette. The German father offers a more believable performance.

The themes of immigration, wayward fathers, daughters in prostitution, and the pursuit of true love resonate strongly, especially with European elements, as Garbo fittingly portrays a Swedish woman."

An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativity. With the freedom of an independent production, one might expect a more innovative and compelling narrative, where the unique talents of both Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell could truly shine. The anticipation for such a collaboration could naturally run high, given the caliber of both actors and the promise of a film not bound by typical studio constraints.

But then why is this movie so bland? Ask the dust. As the film unfolds, it becomes increasingly clear that it doesn't meet the expectations set by its potential. The narrative seems to falter, lacking the depth and engagement one might hope for. This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters. It plunges into the story without establishing a solid foundation for the audience to connect with. No one is given a proper back story, so we don't ever know why the characters act the way they do. The absence of this crucial element leaves viewers at a loss, unable to fully comprehend or empathize with the characters' motivations and actions.

Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination, if you still have one left at the end of this movie. Instead of weaving these explanations into the storyline, the film seems to gloss over them, expecting the audience to fill in the gaps without sufficient context. This approach can be frustrating, as it leaves the viewer with unanswered questions and a sense of detachment from the characters' journeys. The potential for a rich, character-driven narrative is overshadowed by this lack of development.

I told a friend that I went to see this film, and that I thought it was awful. I shared my disappointment, hoping for a discussion that might shed new light on the experience, but the reaction was telling. Her question: ""Not even Colin Farrell could save it?"" This question encapsulates the high expectations placed on an actor of Farrell's stature to elevate the material. My response: ""Not even Colin Farrell's ass could save it."" This response, though lighthearted, underscores the extent of the film's shortcomings. Even the presence of such talented actors couldn't redeem the overall experience, leaving audiences wanting more from a film that had so much promise."

The film's exploration of these heavy themes is intertwined with a narrative that keeps you engaged and invested in the characters' journeys. The complexity of emotions portrayed in this movie is something that resonates with viewers of all ages, making it a timeless piece of art. Don Bluth's direction brings a unique touch that is rarely seen in animated films, allowing audiences to experience a rollercoaster of emotions, from laughter to tears, within a single viewing.

Moreover, the characters are crafted with such depth and personality that they become memorable in their own right. Charlie's charisma and Ann-Marie's innocence create a dynamic duo that captures your heart, making the story even more compelling. Their development throughout the film adds layers to the narrative, ensuring that viewers remain connected to their plight and root for their success.

In conclusion, this movie is a testament to Don Bluth's unparalleled ability to create a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. It challenges viewers to reflect on profound themes while enjoying a beautifully animated story filled with heart and soul. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend experiencing this film for yourself to truly appreciate all the elements that make it a remarkable and honest work of art. Don Bluth, thank you for this unforgettable contribution to the world of animation."

The atmosphere is so vividly unpleasant that it almost becomes a character in itself, adding to the layers of absurdity. Kathleen Turner struts around in a blond wig, getting her kicks from ""pretending"" to be a two-bit hooker. It's a bizarre role, especially considering that she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men that this is the only way she can connect. Her portrayal is simultaneously intriguing and cringe-worthy, a mix that only adds to the film's nonsensical charm.

Meanwhile, Tony Perkins plays a hysterical ""priest"" who is out to maybe murder her—adding yet another movie to the list that ends with Tony Perkins in drag. His performance is over-the-top, embodying the chaotic spirit of the film. The way he navigates his character's questionable motives and erratic behavior is something that has to be seen to be believed. Annie Potts shows up and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit, which is reason enough to hate this movie. It's a true shame, as her comedic timing and charisma could have added a much-needed layer of levity to the proceedings.

So, for those curious or brave enough, rent the UNrated version in the RED box so you can see Turner give a cop a taste of his billy club. This scene is so outrageously executed that I had to pause the VCR until we stopped laughing.

There are so many elements that just don't come together, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying final product. It’s quite a sad way for a great comedian to go out, ending an illustrious career on such a low note. The film's attempt at comedy feels forced and outdated, and it lacks the charm or wit that one might expect. It's truly a letdown, especially for fans who were hoping for one last memorable performance.

His portrayal in that movie really impressed me, and I was hoping to see more of that kind of depth in this film. Unfortunately, even though these two actors were/are capable of good if not great acting moments, some of that was missing here. There were moments where their talent shone through, but overall, it felt like some of their potential wasn't fully realized. Some of the scenes were just not believable and didn't have enough story line support, which was disappointing because it took away from the overall experience.

Though the movie claims influence from the hurricane Katrina aftermath, there was very little (none) to that effect in the movie. I was expecting the film to delve more deeply into the impact and aftermath of such a significant event, but it seemed like the connection was more of a surface-level mention rather than a substantial part of the plot. This was a missed opportunity, as exploring this theme could have added another layer of depth and relevance to the story.

Overall, I liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective. This aspect of the film was intriguing, and it highlighted the bravery and dedication of those involved in rescue operations. The depiction of the challenges faced in these situations was both educational and eye-opening, providing viewers with a glimpse into the complexities of such missions.

The special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating. The visual elements of the film were impressive, and they successfully conveyed the power and unpredictability of the ocean. Not sure I'll ever go deep sea fishing again after seeing some of those intense scenes. The filmmakers did a commendable job in creating a sense of danger and urgency through the special effects, which added to the overall impact of the film.

I expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presented. Given the nature of the story and the potential for emotional depth, it felt like there were missed opportunities to really tug at the heartstrings and create a more moving narrative. The emotional moments that were present didn't always resonate as strongly as they could have, which was a bit of a letdown.

Definitely a movie that could've been seen on DVD. While it had its moments, it wasn't necessarily a film that required a big-screen viewing to appreciate. Watching it in the comfort of one's home would still provide an enjoyable experience without losing much of the film's impact."
"I think I laughed twice. The line where the main character says something about being from the streets. And then I forget the other time I laughed.

The line where the main character says something about being from the streets was one of those moments. It caught me off guard and was genuinely funny. And then I forget the other time I laughed. It was probably in the beginning, when the scenes were still fresh and held some potential for humor. But beyond those two instances, the movie really didn’t offer much in terms of comedic value. 

This has to be one of the thinnest movies ever. The plot seemed almost nonexistent, and the characters lacked depth. It felt as though the writers were relying solely on clichés and tired jokes to carry the entire film. Doesn't Hollywood realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad, really? It’s a shame because there was potential to explore more meaningful themes, yet it was squandered in favor of cheap laughs. The reliance on such humor makes it difficult to connect with the characters or care about their journey.

You can only insult yourself so many times before it loses its impact. It’s as if the movie was trying too hard to be edgy or provocative, but it came across as more desperate than anything else. The humor wasn’t clever or original, and it did little to enhance the story or characters. Instead, it left a sense of disappointment and missed opportunities. I couldn’t help but feel that the creators underestimated their audience, assuming that this type of humor would suffice in place of a well-crafted narrative. 

In the end, the film felt like a hollow shell of what it could have been. There was so much potential to explore deeper, more engaging content, yet it was overshadowed by an over-reliance on humor that didn’t land. It’s frustrating to see how a lack of creativity and depth can lead to such an unsatisfying experience. 2/10"
"I didn't even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing Blade: Trinity, I was messing around on the Trinity board when I saw some user mention how the Wes Craven series is a lot better then the 'crap' that's Blade, So I did my quick research: Checked the scores on IMDb & RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere along the search I found out that this is a sequel to Dracula 2000.

Nope, this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel on.<br /><br />I also must've blinked at some point, because I'm not sure how 'Dracula' got clothes on his body, especially since he's big wild and angry & I figure if I was in that situation, I wouldn't want to be the one dressing him.<br /><br />So the movie ends like any middle movie of a trilogy it doesn't, instead it's a 'Cliff Hangar' where I now get to wait for the 3rd installment 'Legacy'.

From start to finish, the film failed to engage me on any meaningful level.

I watched 'Adam & Paul' immediately before watching this film, and I both laughed and cried on several occasions. This film did not strike even a similar chord. 'Adam & Paul' managed to capture the raw and poignant reality of its characters' lives, evoking both humor and sorrow, whereas this film left me feeling indifferent and unmoved. The directors of 'Human Traffic' may have some off-hand experience of ecstasy, but there is no demonstration of actual drug-related semantic knowledge here. The portrayal of drug culture was superficial and lacked authenticity, failing to reflect the complexities and nuances that surround such a topic. In fact, I find it rather offensive and contraproductive to the strife of making current drug laws less politically oriented. By oversimplifying and misrepresenting drug use, the film does a disservice to the ongoing conversation about drug policy and reform.

Watch 'Requiem for a Dream' if what you're looking for is an amazing, touching film about drugs. In contrast to this film, 'Requiem for a Dream' offers a powerful and harrowing depiction of addiction, with strong performances and a compelling narrative that leaves a lasting impact. It serves as a reminder of what a truly captivating and thought-provoking film about drugs can achieve, making it a much more worthwhile viewing experience."

"I was very curious about Anatomy (aka Anatomie) and if I was going to see it, I was going to have to buy it since no video stores in my area carried the film. Since it was not a low-priced DVD, I did take a chance and thought I'd take a peek at other comments on IMDb. Many of the comments didn't give me enough hope of forking out lots of bucks for a film I had never seen nor had any clues about. I basically got the idea it was a sexy youth-oriented romp being compared to many cookie-cutter teen thrillers. Well, something in the back of my mind told me to ignore those types of comments and buy it! I did, and was I pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />If it is going to be compared to any other films, I would say it's a variation of Coma and Extreme Measures. I couldn't see any comparison to films like Scream, Urban Legends, et al. Yes, the cast is young (that's because they're med students! At least they aren't the increasingly boring high school type characters), and yes, some are lusty (basically the character played by Anna Loos is, and it is handled quite tastefully in the German language version), but Anatomy is well constructed, there is a tense mood throughout, the sets are amazing, the makeup effects are a wow, and Franka Potente is very credible in her role. I found myself enjoying all of it despite a few gaping holes in the plot! The story of a student discovering a sort-of secret society doing autopsies on still-living patients is a rather creepy scenario and what happens to those patients afterwards is quite clever. Sure, you could ask why didn't she just GET OUT OF THAT TOWN? Okay, but then the film would be over within a half hour.<br /><br />This was the first effort from the German part of Columbia Pictures, and it's actually quite an impressive one. There was a bit of care in the production and to actually offer some genuine thrills is an accomplishment. It is a bit mature in mind, as it doesn't resort to constant opportunities for sexual encounters(a breast fest) or juvenile drug jokes. Anna Loos' character, while often making sexual remarks and looking for some fun, was actually a nice touch--having a character that was a woman more intelligent than any of the men in the school. She found that sex was really just a distraction for her and the men rather lacking.<br /><br />THE IMPORTANT STUFF: Watching this film in the original German language with English or French subtitles is the BEST way to enjoy it. I saw the theatrical trailers dubbed in English and was disgusted by the change it made in the film's tone. I have never seen a properly dubbed film in my life--they never can find voices that suit the film's actors or characters. Sure enough, I tried to watch some of Anatomy dubbed in English and the intelligence level of it dropped severely, making it seem more like a comedy. A good example is when one guy was freaked out at being cut open and screamed to be sewn back up--hearing it in German he sounded frantic, but dubbed in English he sounded like a comedian. Frankly, I'm sick of hearing people say they can't handle reading subtitles or watch a ""letterboxed"" film. Anatomy comes off as silly with dubbed voices that seem octaves too high for any of the people you see in the film, and Anna Loos' sexual comments then just sound like awful remarks right out of Fast Times At Ridgemont High. I wonder if the negative comments about Anatomy are from people who watched it dubbed, it just doesn't seem like the same film at all! This is not a cheap horror film and deserves to be viewed as it was created. Interesting to note that some of the English subtitles are different in scenes in the feature and the ""making of"" supplement.<br /><br />As it turns out, I gambled and won with Anatomy. It's a competent thriller with likeable characters and doesn't try to go for cheap thrills.",1,3852,True,44328,"I was curious about Anatomy (aka Anatomie) and decided to buy it since no stores in my area carried the film.

Dubbing often fails to match the original actors' voices, reducing the film's intelligence level. For example, a frantic scene in German sounds comedic when dubbed in English. Negative comments may stem from those who watched the dubbed version, which doesn't do the film justice.

Rather, it features a young swine, one with an appetite more insatiable than John Belushi's character in ""Animal House,"" which is quite a feat considering the gluttony displayed in that iconic film. This pig's voracious hunger knows no bounds, and it becomes a central theme of the cartoon. His mother, in her attempts to control his eating habits, repeatedly scolds him. However, her efforts do no good, as he continues to indulge in his excessive eating habits. The humor in this dynamic is evident, yet it portrays a deeper commentary on indulgence and self-control.

This insatiable hunger eventually leads him to another house, where the plot thickens as he encounters a deranged scientist. This character adds an intriguing twist to the narrative, as he force-feeds the young swine more than any mere mortal can handle. The sequence is both comical and slightly unsettling, as it pushes the boundaries of what might be considered reasonable consumption. However, there's a surprise at the end that adds a layer of intrigue and unexpected resolution to the story.

I would mostly say that this cartoon seemed like a placeholder in between the really great cartoons, as Daffy Duck, one of the most beloved characters in animation history, debuted just three months after this came out. The timing of this release places it in a unique spot within the context of animation history. But make no mistake about it, they do some neat things here that are worth noting. The whole force-feeding sequence, for instance, looks more relevant today, given the obesity epidemic overtaking our country. This particular scene resonates with contemporary issues, making the cartoon seem somewhat ahead of its time in its inadvertent social commentary.

Anyway, while not the greatest cartoon ever produced, it is certainly worth seeing for its unique storyline and the interesting elements it brings to the table. The cartoon offers a blend of humor and social reflection, making it an intriguing watch despite its shortcomings in comparison to later, more iconic animations."

"One would think that a film based on the life of the Japanese author Yukio Mishima would be a daunting if not impossible task. However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" Mishima that is both superb & complex. While it is not a literal biography, Schrader & his co-screenwriter Leonard Scharder (his brother) have taken several incidents from his life, including his sucide and crafted what can best be described as incidental tableaus that are visually sparse and stunning. Mishima's homosexuality is almost not there, due to legal threats from his widow, but in spite of this, the film is still terrific, and one of the best films I saw in 1985. I should also mention the important contribution of Philip Glass who did the score, which adds an additional texture to the film, and is superior to the one he did for Scorsese's Kundun. Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.

"I must preface this comment with a sort of admission: I suppose I just have a soft spot for the original 60s-70s TV series.

"Just got back from a free screening and I'm very glad I didn't pay to see this very sub-par film. The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults.

The script is full of holes (has he written a book yet, or not?), clichés (relationship trouble: she works days, he works nights), and provides so little insight into such basics as character motivation that it requires a voice-over narration just to move the story along. The script leaves much to be desired in terms of coherence and depth, as it is riddled with inconsistencies and overused tropes that fail to engage the viewer on a meaningful level. The narrative lacks any semblance of originality or creativity, relying heavily on predictable plot devices that do little to capture the audience's imagination or interest. In an attempt to keep the audience from dozing off, it includes a street fight scene that is about as realistic as a high school production of Julius Caesar. This particular scene is so poorly executed that it borders on the absurd, with choreography and acting that lack any sense of authenticity or believability. The fight scene, much like the rest of the film, is devoid of any genuine tension or drama, leaving the audience feeling detached and uninvested in the outcome. If your idea of scintillating dialogue is ""I'll see your ten, and raise you twenty,"" then RUN to see this movie. Otherwise, save your money. The dialogue throughout the film is uninspired and lacks any wit or charm, failing to deliver the kind of engaging exchanges that would make the film worth watching. The interactions between characters are stilted and unconvincing, further contributing to the overall lack of engagement and entertainment value. In summary, this film is an exercise in mediocrity, with its lackluster script, uninspired performances, and predictable plot offering little to no redeeming qualities. Save your money and time for something more worthwhile and engaging, unless you find joy in the mundane and predictable."

Stanley plays ""Vaselino,"" a bullfighter who seems pretty dim-witted and wins only because the bulls seem too lazy and non-aggressive. His character is portrayed in such a way that he's both endearing and comically inept. Even the bull at the end of the film, who has supposedly killed ten men, is obviously just a domesticated bull. This twist adds to the humor because the audience is led to expect a formidable opponent, yet what they get is just the opposite. 

Not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but still a cute and harmless film. Despite its simplicity, the film manages to entertain with its lighthearted approach and playful jabs at a more serious film genre. Its charm lies in its ability to poke fun without malice, making it an enjoyable watch for those who appreciate classic comedy. Even though it may not leave a lasting impression, it offers a delightful glimpse into Stan Laurel's early comedic style."

"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more. A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it). But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.

It's almost like this movie appeared out of nowhere, and now I'm regretting this spontaneous purchase. The thing is, I have a special place in my heart for the original Christmas Vacation, and I just can't understand why they couldn't make an actual sequel that lives up to the brilliance of the first one. But instead, I ended up with this DVD that seems to be universally panned. Randy Quaid, oh my goodness, what happened? He looks like he's been on the same drugs as Jerry Lewis, and that's saying something. I don't even know what to expect from his performance in this film. It's frustrating because I really wanted to enjoy a good Christmas movie, and now I'm stuck with this. Maybe if I ever get my DVD player working again, I'll finally give it a watch, but honestly, I'm not in any rush. For now, I'm just going to remember the joy of the first Christmas Vacation and try to forget that this one even exists. If only I had checked the reviews before buying it. Lesson learned, I guess. At least I have The Chronicles of Riddick to keep me entertained, even though my DVD player decided to quit on me right in the middle of it. What a night."
"I was absolutely blown away by John Cassavetes's Opening Night.

"In the seedy streets somewhere in New York City, a lonely punk named Tromeo ( Will Keenan) has little friends but all they ever do is get tattoos, piercing and just party all the time.

During this era, Thatcher was often at the height of most political jokes, and Bill (played by Belinda Lang) made it a habit to blame Thatcher for anything she could. The phrase ""Bloody Thatcher"" was a sentiment possibly shared with most of us during that time. The show featured David, the typical teenager who had a penchant for cutting up brains with bread knives, adding a unique twist to the character dynamic. Meanwhile, Jenny, the moody older teenage child, was only interested in boys, and more boys, leading to a series of humorous teenage antics and situations. Bill and Ben were portrayed as hard-working parents, doing as much as they could to keep their family afloat, all while struggling within the challenging economic climate of the early 90's. Granted, the first two series of this sitcom were not as successful as the latter ones; however, series 3 onwards is where it all truly kicks off with more laughs than I care to count. Overall, this show didn't get the best viewing times, and they ought to have held on a bit longer, as it had the potential to grow even further. Clearly, they couldn't have carried on after Gary Olsen passed away, but I think they should get rid of shows like ""Catherine Tate,"" ""The Office,"" and ""Little Britain"" and bring back the classics that defined a generation's humor and provided endless entertainment. These classic comedies have a timeless quality that resonates with audiences across different eras, offering a delightful escape into a world of laughter and nostalgia. The witty writing, memorable characters, and the unique charm of this 90's sitcom created a loyal fan base that still cherishes the show's impact, making it a true gem of its time. Bringing back such classics would not only honor the legacy of the actors and creators but also introduce a new generation to the humor and warmth that these shows brought to our screens."
"This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel known to me. The representation of the court of Chancery as a 'character' in the drama is magnificent.

"When one considers that Carson McCullers is one of the foremost literary figures of the 20th century, it seems that it needs a very great lack of talent to be able to ruin one of her stories, but this movie shows it can be done! How do actors ingratiate their way to becoming directors? Wooden, unatmospheric, unsympathetic, totally out of sync with the poetic compassion of McCullers' writing, my jaw dropped with horror and disbelief that such a mish-mash of a movie could ever have found finance and backers.

The plot, which tries to blend elements of supernatural horror and video game culture, falls flat on its face, leaving viewers more confused than frightened. The characters are one-dimensional, lacking any depth or development, which makes it impossible to care about their fates as they meet their inevitable demises. The film's pacing is another issue, dragging at times and then rushing through moments that could have been more impactful if given proper attention. The special effects are mediocre at best, failing to deliver any real sense of horror or tension. In an era where horror films were beginning to experiment with new techniques and storytelling methods, ""Stay Alive"" seems stuck in a formulaic rut, relying on clichés and tired tropes rather than offering anything fresh or innovative. The lack of creativity is evident in every frame, from the uninspired cinematography to the forgettable score that accompanies the movie. Overall, the film is a missed opportunity, squandering a potentially interesting premise with poor execution and a lack of vision. Viewers looking for a scare or even a mildly entertaining horror experience should look elsewhere, as ""Stay Alive"" offers nothing but disappointment and frustration.

It leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans, what they're capable of, and the very real possibility that our government(s)does not necessarily have our personal best interest in it's heart.",1,882,False,38911,"I really love this movie. It has a very real feel to it. I believe it was never popular because of the subject matter, however, because of the subject matter, it makes the movie all that much more important. The way it touches on themes that are often avoided in mainstream cinema gives it a unique edge that many movies lack. It's rare to find a film that dares to explore such challenging and thought-provoking issues, and for that reason alone, it deserves more recognition and appreciation from audiences. The filmmakers have done an exceptional job in bringing this story to life, with a level of authenticity that is both compelling and unsettling.

This is an ""A"" movie and I recommend it highly. The craftsmanship involved in the production is evident in every scene, from the meticulous attention to detail in the set design to the hauntingly beautiful cinematography that captures the mood perfectly. The performances by the cast are equally commendable, with each actor delivering a portrayal that feels both genuine and haunting. If you liked ""1984"" book or movie, I think you will like this one as well. It shares a similar dystopian vision, one that challenges viewers to question the nature of society and authority. The parallels between the two stories are striking, and fans of Orwell's work will likely find much to appreciate here.

This is harsh, to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some pretty vile. The film does not shy away from depicting the darker aspects of human nature, and it is unflinching in its portrayal of the lengths to which people will go in the pursuit of power and control. Not for the weak at heart or stomach. No gore, but this movie is so great at projecting the mental anticipation it doesn't need blood and guts. The psychological tension is palpable, and the way the narrative builds a sense of dread and foreboding is masterfully done. The absence of graphic violence only serves to heighten the impact of the story, leaving much to the imagination and allowing viewers to engage with the material on a deeper level.

If you are not a realist or a pessimistic person, I don't think you will enjoy it. The film's themes are undeniably bleak, and it does not offer easy answers or comforting resolutions. It leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans, what they're capable of, and the very real possibility that our government(s) does not necessarily have our personal best interest in its heart. The questions it raises about morality, power, and the nature of humanity are not easily dismissed, and they linger long after the credits roll. For those willing to confront these difficult topics, the movie offers a rewarding and thought-provoking experience that is well worth the emotional investment."

"The lousiest of all lousy Jaws rip-offs was regretfully made by one of my all-time favorite directors; Lamberto Bava (here under his John Old Jr. pseudonym).

"Being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, and therefore having seen a large number of these films, it is rare that one strikes me as totally unique. For that matter, it is equally rare that I am gasping for breath through the laughter during several scenes. The love story is a little thin on the ground, but I'd say that's probably for the best, as this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on ""comedy"", and in any case it stretches the bounds of credibility just a little more than I like most rom com's to do. The four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this film, but in any film I've seen in a long while. I hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a ""10"" over a ""9"" as a rating, as I believe that far too many people use it indiscriminately, and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact. I'm also a big Meg Ryan fan, which helps, but this is one of the few films I've seen in which I'd say she is comprehensively overshadowed. She and Tim Robbins are cast as the leads, but for me play second fiddle to the antics of the bumbling intellectuals. A genuine laugh-out-loud type film.",1,1153,True,20930,"As a big fan of romantic comedies, it's rare that one strikes me as unique or leaves me gasping for breath from laughter.

"After seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think other reviewers have mentioned this also, namely, what exactly is the nature and motivation of the Chris Sarandon character? Has he raped other victims before? Is he completely psychotic or an ""average"" sociopath? How did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister? Is this character at all credible, or is it just a matter of more background being necessary? He seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character, and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young, vulnerable girls. This seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general. It has nothing to do with his performance, which is terrifyingly convincing.The movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject, without quite settling into either mode.

"I laughed my ass off for an hour. I had no idea who Dan Finneity was. Why haven't I heard of Dan Finnerty before? He's hysterical and so are his backup singers.

Though I have to admit it is not as good on a little TV.<br /><br />I do not have older children so I do not know what they would think of it. <br /><br />The songs are very cute. My daughter keeps singing them over and over.<br /><br />Hope this helps.",1,540,False,22319,"I saw this movie at the theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I vividly remember sitting in those plush red seats, eyes wide with wonder, as the magical world unfolded on the big screen. The experience was truly enchanting, and I loved it then with all the enthusiasm and imagination that a child can muster. Fast forward to today, and I have recently come to own a VHS version of this beloved film. Holding that VHS tape in my hands brought back a flood of nostalgic memories, and I couldn't wait to share this piece of my childhood with my own children.

My 4 and 6-year-old children adore this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it. It's become a treasured part of our family movie nights, and their excitement is infectious. They eagerly anticipate each viewing, their eyes lighting up with the same wonder I once had. It's heartwarming to see them enjoy it just as much as I did at their age, if not more. Their laughter and joy fill the room, turning our living room into a mini-theater of delight. 

I have to admit that I’ve enjoyed watching it again too. Reliving the story and seeing it through my children's eyes adds a new layer of enjoyment. Though I have to admit it is not as good on a little TV as it was on the big screen. The grandeur of the theater experience is hard to replicate at home, but the charm of the movie still shines through. The colorful characters and engaging plot captivate their young minds, much like it did mine years ago. 

I do not have older children, so I do not know what they would think of it. Perhaps the magic might not hold the same spell over them, but who knows? There’s a timeless quality to the movie that could appeal to all ages. It’s a movie that speaks to the child in all of us, no matter how old we grow.

The songs in the movie are very cute. My daughter keeps singing them over and over, her sweet voice filling the house with melodies that stick in your head long after the credits roll. The catchy tunes and whimsical lyrics have a way of embedding themselves into our daily lives, providing a delightful soundtrack to our days. 

Hope this helps. I really do think this movie is a gem, and I'm glad to see it being appreciated by the next generation."

"I saw this film in Winnipeg recently - appropriate, given the location used.

It's a testament to her skill as an actress that she can portray such a character with authenticity and nuance. It's great to be able to see favorite characters, ones that have left a lasting impression on me, come to life so authentically on the screen.

"Ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours. When nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point I should have left. But, ever hopeful, I stayed. And left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time. Acting was OK, but the story line is so transparent and weak. The script is about as lame as it could get, but again, stretching out the ten minute plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue.",0,458,False,12465,"The film felt like an exercise in stretching a ten-minute story into what ended up being nearly a two-hour runtime. As I sat through it, I couldn't shake the feeling that the content was thin, and when I reached the halfway mark without any significant developments, I considered leaving the theater. However, I held onto a sense of hope that perhaps the latter half would redeem the experience. Unfortunately, my optimism was misplaced, and I left the theater with a palpable sense of guilt over the time I had squandered. While the acting was passable, the storyline itself was painfully transparent and weak, offering little in the way of intrigue or substance. The script, too, left much to be desired; it was about as uninspired and lackluster as it could possibly be. This lack of depth in the plot meant that there wasn't much opportunity for engaging dialogue or character development. The whole experience felt like a drawn-out ordeal, with a plot designed to fill time rather than to tell a compelling story. In the end, it was a disappointment, characterized by a thin narrative stretched far beyond its capacity to hold an audience's attention."
"Back in the mid/late 80s, an OAV anime by title of ""Bubblegum Crisis"" (which I think is a military slang term for when technical equipment goes haywire) made its debut on video, taking inspiration from ""Blade Runner"", ""The Terminator"" and maybe even ""Robocop"", with a little dash of Batman/Bruce Wayne - Iron Man/Tony Stark and Charlie's Angel's girl power thrown in for good measure. 8 episodes long, the overall story was that in 21st century Tokyo, Japan, year 2032-2033, living machines called Boomers were doing manual labor and sometimes cause problems. A special, SWAT like branch of law enforcers, the Advanced Police (AD Police for short) were formed to handle the boomers, but were mostly ineffective, prompting millionaire scientist Sylia Stingray, the daughter of the scientist who made the boomers, to create four powered combat armor (hard suits) to be worn by women to fight the boomers and fight the evil corporation that produced the boomers, GENOM. That group becomes known as the Knight Sabers, and in addition to ring leader Sylia, her rag-tag band of rebel women included Priss Asagiri, a struggling rock and roll gal with a passion for motorcycles and a disdain for cops, Linna Yamazaki, an aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends, and Nene Romanova, a young officer of the ADP and expert computer hacker (the first in a long line). GENOM, meanwhile, is represented by Quincy, a tall, gaunt old guy who happens to own the company, his younger assistant Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3) and an annoying boomer man named Largo. Other characters included Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two AD Police detectives (Leon appeared in a spin-off/prequel anime, ""AD Police Files"" which I heard was very dark), their balding, overweight boss Chief Todo, Sylia's younger brother Mackey, and a funny little mechanic known as Dr. Raven, who apparently helps Sylia with maintaining the suits. Aside from the overall Knight Sabers & AD Police VS GENOM storyline, there was also another storyline involving a friend of Linna's who was apparently a daughter in a big crime family, the annoying Largo trying to usurp GENOM, and various Priss-wants-revenge-for-a-minor-character story. Oh and did I mention that there were hints that Sylia herself might have been a boomer?<br /><br />Well, it was a great watch, full of chaos and mayhem and even some very nice pop songs, but it was not without its flaws, some of which, unfortunately, were due to the fact that the series was discontinued after episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in all. So some of the storylines, like Largo's scheme (or schemes), the family of Linna's ill-fated friend, and Sylia's origins, were never resolved. Another problem with the series was that at the time Priss was the most popular character, so a good portion of the series focused on her, and unfortunately, most of the Priss oriented episodes basically focused on Priss self-righteously seeking justice/revenge for some secondary character who had never appeared before but happened to be a friend of hers, yet she rarely went out of her way for her the Knight Sabers, who were always bailing her out of trouble and for some reason cared a great deal about her well-being (just to be fair though, she did go to rescue Linna in episode 7, and her boyfriend got killed by a boomer and the ADP acted wrongly in the investigation). This meant we didn't really get to focus on the more interesting back story of Sylia, or even the day-to-day antics of Nene and Linna. Linna had two episodes oriented around her, which pertained to her friend with the mafia family, while Nene managed to snag the last episode for herself, which showed her eternal good cheer was genuinely good spirits and not ditziness. Nene also got to put her computer skills to good use quite a bit, or she sometimes just acted like a lovable goof, which put her screen time and character development a few notches above poor Linna, who was often thrust into the background with only her greed and her tendency to eat up boyfriends to get her any attention. Don't get me wrong, I like it and I love the overall concept of it all, but it did irk me a little bit. Also this is one of those runner-ups for ""worst English voice dubbing of all time"" features, meaning you'd better stick to the Japanese. Some of the voices were okay (some really did match their characters personas) but others were just flat and passionless or, in the case of Priss, really overacted.<br /><br />Well, Tokyo 2040 comes along and pretty much tosses all that out the window. Set a few years ahead, the story here is that after earthquakes shattered Tokyo, GENOM's boomers rebuilt the city into a big old paradise, except the boomers still have a tendency to fly off the handle, which prompts the AD Police to be formed followed by the Knight Sabers being formed. So the overall story is the same, but the backstories of the characters and the look and attitudes of the characters have changed a lot.<br /><br />1) Originally Sylia had short purplish black hair and brown eyes, was usually dressed like a stern, proper business woman and was distant from others. 2040 Sylia has more of a super-model look to her, dressing more provocatively and possessing white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (runs the gamut from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally looking purple or gray), and also 2040 Sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman who flies off the handle when she's not in public, and possibly keeps even more secrets than before. Sylia also doesn't take as much risk on the battlefield, as she is more of a stay-in-the-mobile-pit type here, but she does do battle when she has to.<br /><br />2) Originally Priss was a short woman with an Afro and a really bad temper, always picking fights with people who offended her, always biting off more than she could chew, etc. 2040 Priss, however, has gone the way of the Clint Eastwood loner - very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original Sylia you might say), so she's not really attached to anyone. Also her hair is more stingry and cat-like (a big improvement) and she is clad in leather like Trinity from ""The Matrix"" (although much less annoying than before, unfortunately, the writers screw her in the end when revealing her reasons for hating the ADP).<br /><br />3) Originally Linna had this big black hair going for her, but now her hair is shorter, browner, and, well, more 90s like. 2040 Linna is also an office lady who has bad luck with being sexually harrassed. As if to apologize for the way she was treated by the OAV writers, the 2040 writers actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to Linna, writing her as a country girl new to the city but determined to meet the Knight Sabers and win a spot with them, which she eventually does.<br /><br />4) Originally a short red haired girl who was often the victim of ridicule and ate a lot of candy, Nene is now a short blonde haired girl who likes to tease and take pot shots at ADP detective Leon McNichol (revenge for him toying with her in the OAV?) and other characters, even her surrogate big sister Linna and Mackey, Sylia's ""brother"", whom she becomes infatuated with. Cockey and arrogant, she still eats a lot of candy and is a master hacker, but she is eventually deflated and grows beyond her comic relief status.<br /><br />5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a tall, stoic, ruggedly handsome man with long black hair (he looks like Adrian Paul from TV's Highlander), he replaces Dr. Raven from the old series and now serves as the man who gives maitenance to Sylia's hard suits. Nigel is also Sylia's lover, but you wouldn't know it by his demeanor. He's kind of the father/big brother/mentor figure to Mackey.<br /><br />6) Leon and Daley are back, but of course differently. The original Leon was a tall pretty boy built like a baseball player with slicked back brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, tight blue jeans, and always carrying a revolver that could magically pack more whallop than a howitzer if necessary; while he wasn't really a bad guy deep down, he was kind of a jerk, but he served mostly as comic relief, as he tried to pursue Priss romantically (exactly what he saw in her is a mystery) but occasionally he and Daley served as information guides to important plot points. Also the original Daley was a fairly muscular red head who dressed in pink/purple suits as he was a flamboyantly homosexual character who was always hitting on Leon when not providing important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a pretty boy but more your typical rugged tough guy type, with spiked black hair, brown eyes, tall and sporting big muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue dockers (he actually looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger a little bit, or maybe a pumped up Colin Farrell, or Hugh Jackman), and he still carries a revolver, a BIG one, but it's not as powerful as before. Although 2040 Leon still has a bit of an attitude probelm (especially in approaching Priss), he's not nearly as much of a jerk as he was in the old series, but he does have a bad temper and he is easily annoyed by Nene and Daley (also he drinks way too much coffee). Oh, and Leon is still after Priss, but he has a lot more luck this time around. Daley, meanwhile, is now a taller (but not as tall as Leon) more pretty boyish looking guy with red rimmed glasses, a white suit, green eyes, and light brown hair, and he carries a big machine gun (he actually looks like James Marsden from the X-Men films); Daley is a lot smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the OAV and, although it's not completely clear, his homosexual tendencies have been almost totally disappeared, save a moment of what appears to be jealousy when he hears about Leon inquiring about Priss's e-mail.<br /><br />7) Brian J. Mason (what does that ""J"" stand for?) is back, and so is Quincy, but Mason is much more the main villain here, with Quincy as co-villain, as he is no longer a towering figure of terror but a vegetable with a bunch of batteries and wires plugged into him. Mason now sports slicked back brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the OAV (he actually looks like OAV Leon in a suit) and he is very much from the Alan Rickman school of villains.<br /><br />8) Though a pervert in the first series, Mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. Of course, there are lots of things different about Mackey in 2040, but they won't be revealed here.<br /><br />9) Sylia now has a companion, an Alfred-the-butler type named Henderson, who worries about her and the gang.<br /><br />10) In the original series, boomers were like the Replicants in ""Blade Runner"", armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions, but in 2040, they're more of the dumb-monsters-on-the-rampage type. Most of the time they're just big robots who do whatever they're programmed to do (heavy labor, combat, clean up, etc) and they have this tendency to ""go rogue"", which means try to evolve and become a monster in the process.<br /><br />What does stay the same is the theme of humanity VS technology (do machines have souls?). Sadly, this series, though well animated and well written, only runs 26 episodes, so it moves by faster than one might like, especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters, and unfortunately it still ends on a cliff hanger with unresolved storyline bits (which I will not discuss here. What saves this show and makes it what it is, however, is the characters, a colorful cast of screwballs they are, ranging from stoic loners, psycho women, genocidal mad men, rough neck cops, sardonic intellectuals, wise old sages, and loveable innocents, much more diverse than before and with a lot more to play off of, they're enough to make you wish this show had gone longer.<br /><br />It's not great, but it's a good watch. Also the English dub (by ADV) is quite good, though not without a few flat spots, but certainly better than the dub on the original.",1,12129,True,41512,"Back in the mid/late 80s, an OAV anime titled ""Bubblegum Crisis"" debuted, drawing inspiration from ""Blade Runner,"" ""The Terminator,"" ""Robocop,"" and elements of Batman, Iron Man, and Charlie's Angels. Set in 21st century Tokyo in 2032-2033, the series follows the Knight Sabers, a group of women in powered suits fighting rogue Boomers and the evil corporation GENOM. Led by millionaire scientist Sylia Stingray, the team includes Priss Asagiri, Linna Yamazaki, and Nene Romanova. The series, intended to be 13 episodes but cut to 8, left several storylines unresolved. Priss was the focus due to her popularity, overshadowing deeper storylines about Sylia and the other characters. The English dub was criticized, so watching in Japanese is recommended.

In ""Tokyo 2040,"" the series reimagines the story with changes to character backstories and designs. Sylia becomes emotionally unstable with a model-like appearance, Priss is a stoic loner, Linna is a country girl new to the city, and Nene is a teasing blonde. New characters like Nigel Kirkland replace Dr. Raven. The AD Police detectives Leon and Daley return, with Leon as a rugged tough guy and Daley losing his flamboyant traits. Brian J. Mason and Quincy are back, with Mason as the main villain. Boomer designs change from sentient beings to rogue machines.

The theme of humanity vs. technology persists, but the 26-episode series ends with unresolved plots. Despite its brevity, the diverse and colorful cast makes it engaging. The English dub by ADV is better than the original but not flawless. Overall, it's a good watch, though not great."
"I saw this movie alone when i was an early teen in my hometown in India, at a time when the only thing that fascinated me aside from girls were Tigers. I came home after watching it, with a glazed look in my eye, wanting to be that bloke in the movie that befriended the Tigers. What a movie and what a moment that was! The theatre I saw it in does not exist any and has given way to a shopping mall. I don't know how i'd feel about it now after so many years and do not want to spoil a childhood memory by finding this movie available on DVD or something similar and not finding it interesting anymore. I have learned from previous experience that a childhood memory is often tarnished when one travels life's jaded highways occasionally trying to rediscover their unadulterated past by way of movies, only to find its gushing innocence completely soppy and not welcome anymore.

The theatre I saw it in no longer exists and has been replaced by a shopping mall. I’m hesitant to revisit it now after so many years, afraid to spoil a childhood memory by finding it less interesting. Past experiences have taught me that childhood memories can be tarnished when revisited later in life, losing their innocence. I don’t want to throw away the memory of this movie. Without kids, I might be selfish in leaving this movie in my mind, not wanting it on DVD. But if you’re of a similar age, try to watch this film if you can. It’ll be worth it."

"I bought this movie last weekend at my local Movie Gallery. It was buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one more so I chose this one. Horrible mistake. The box reads like it would be a really good movie. Well, it starts out like it is going to be this great movie. For about 5 minutes, that is. The movie is about a young woman, Laila, who gets killed trying to save her beau, Jack, from a bull. Laila's dad, Cordobes, is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull, and goes on this hunt to find him. That was the first 5 minutes that is good. What follows after that is only gonna get 100 times worse. Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever. Jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mary who gives him a ride. I think Mary is supposed to be a virgin Mary type character. You know, Jesus' mother. But, who knows, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. As they're running... we get to see bad guys, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc... And all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what's going on. Needless to say, I took the movie back and exchanged it for something else.

"Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One) gives us an exciting film where the accolades go to the supporting actor, John Malkovich. His criminal attempting to assassinate the President was first-rate and credible.<br /><br />That is not to diminish the efforts of Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo, or even Fred Dalton Thompson, who plays a real jerk of a White House Chief of Staff. Eastwood was great, and I love any film that Russo is in.<br /><br />The movie feature original music by five time Oscar winner (Malèna, Bugsy, The Untouchables, The Mission, Days of Heaven) Ennio Morricone. That alone makes it worth your time.",1,626,False,42905,"Wolfgang Petersen, renowned for his work on films such as ""Das Boot"" and ""Air Force One,"" delivers an exhilarating cinematic experience with this film, where the spotlight shines brightly on the exceptional supporting performance by John Malkovich. Malkovich's portrayal of a criminal mastermind attempting to assassinate the President is nothing short of first-rate, bringing a level of credibility and intensity that captivates the audience from start to finish.

This is not to diminish the outstanding efforts of the lead actors, Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo, who both deliver remarkable performances that elevate the film to new heights. Eastwood, with his signature gravitas and charisma, commands the screen, while Russo, whose presence I adore in any film she graces, brings a perfect blend of strength and vulnerability to her role. Additionally, Fred Dalton Thompson shines in his role as the White House Chief of Staff, playing a real jerk with an authenticity that adds depth to the story.

The movie is further enriched by the original music composed by the legendary Ennio Morricone, a five-time Oscar winner known for his unforgettable scores in films such as ""Malèna,"" ""Bugsy,"" ""The Untouchables,"" ""The Mission,"" and ""Days of Heaven."" Morricone's music alone makes the film worth your time, adding layers of emotion and tension that perfectly complement the narrative. With such a stellar cast and an iconic musical score, this film is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates a well-crafted thriller with top-notch performances and an unforgettable soundtrack."
"The film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour, but nothing more.

The scenario is skillfully based on the novel by the legendary Vladimir Nabokov, and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. The filmmakers have done an exceptional job in capturing the essence of Nabokov's work, making it a must-watch for both fans of the book and newcomers alike.

The photography of the film is excellent, creating a visually stunning experience that complements the intricate narrative. The cinematography captures the mood and essence of each scene, drawing the audience deeper into the world of the characters. The acting is also top-notch, with both John Turturro and Emily Watson delivering outstanding performances. Turturro definitely gives what can be considered his best performance to date, proving that he's worth much more than what we may have previously thought. His portrayal of the character is nuanced and compelling, bringing depth and authenticity to the role. Watson also performs brilliantly, adding her own unique touch to the film.

The story revolves around a phenomenal chess player, portrayed by Turturro, who is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life. This character's idiosyncrasies and genius are masterfully depicted, making him both intriguing and relatable. The film is presented in a non-linear fashion, with multiple flashbacks of Luzhin's childhood. Through these flashbacks, the complex character of Luzhin is described in detail, allowing the audience to gain a deeper understanding of his motivations, struggles, and triumphs.

I find myself at a loss for words to express just how much I enjoyed this film. It is a cinematic gem that deserves to be seen and appreciated by a wide audience. I have nothing more to say, other than to wholeheartedly suggest this film to anyone and everyone. It is a remarkable piece of art that will leave a lasting impression on all who watch it."

"I would firstly say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood, I couldn't read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I did really like the concept. If you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie.

The makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, lets face it, humorous. I thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when I was a kid, and I am not ashamed to say that I still do.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general don't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum, they've got heavy calibre machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, a tank and a helicopter and they're hell bent on making feudal Japan theirs. Which is what I'd like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots.<br /><br />In short the movies worth watching, it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise, and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like G.I.

From the moment the opening credits rolled, I had a sinking feeling in my stomach that I was in for a long night, and unfortunately, my instincts were correct. The dialogue was stilted and unnatural, making it impossible to connect with any of the characters or care about their journeys. The pacing was excruciatingly slow, dragging through scene after scene with no sense of urgency or direction. The cinematography, which one might expect to be a saving grace in a European film, was shockingly uninspired and lacked any visual appeal. Each frame seemed carelessly composed, leaving the audience with nothing to latch onto visually or emotionally. The music, if you could call it that, was an assault on the senses, clashing with the scenes and further detracting from any potential enjoyment.

As the film slogged on, it became increasingly clear that the narrative was going nowhere. Subplots were introduced and then abandoned without resolution, leaving gaping holes in the story that were impossible to ignore. The supposed climax was so poorly executed that it elicited more laughter than tension, completely undermining whatever semblance of drama the film had attempted to build. By the time the credits finally rolled, it was a relief to escape the torturous experience. This film is a testament to the dangers of valuing reputation over quality and serves as a reminder that not all films deserve a place in the spotlight. Save yourself the time and disappointment and steer clear of this cinematic disaster."
"Wow, the plot for this film is all over the place! There is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin!! And, as a result, none of it seemed particularly believable.<br /><br />The movie starts with Kay Francis as a housewife living in a small town. She's had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to Broadway. When a big-time actor arrives in town, she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost. But, her husband is worried about shenanigans--as this actor is a cad. So, the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor--and the actor dies! As a result, he's convicted of First Degree Murder!!! Not Manslaughter, but Murder 1! Now, pregnant and in need of funds, Kay goes to New York. But Broadway jobs aren't to be found, so she's forced to take any job--even Burlesque. Unable to adequately care for her young daughter, she gives it to another woman to raise. However, eventually she does find a job in a real Broadway play and everything looks rosy. But, the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play. Despondent, she makes her way to England and becomes a real star. Years later, she returns to New York to get her kid--but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother. At the same time, her husband's lawyer now thinks that if he gets $10,000 he can get the man out of prison. As another reviewer wrote, is this to bribe people?! How can $10,000 get him out otherwise--maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up!! Wow--this is enough for 2 or 3 films! And, all this occurs by the 45 minute mark!!! Believe it or not, there's quite a bit more to it. If you really care, see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds.<br /><br />This is sort of like 'kitchen sink writing'--throwing in practically everything and hoping, somehow, it will all work.

However, when you do see them, they are also very well done, especially considering the limitations of special effects at the time. It’s important to remember that SFX was done in those days without the benefit of computers, which meant that some poor devil had to actually put all that hair and fake tusks on real elephants! The same effect was used on the elephants in ""Quest for Fire,"" which is a testament to the creativity and resourcefulness of filmmakers back then. Overall, it's a better than average adventure film that provides a chance for the star, Rod Cameron, to play something besides a cowboy, a role he also did very well over the years.

Team it up with ""Chopper"" and ""Dirty Deeds"" for your Aussie Crime fest or ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Miller's Crossing"" for an International falling short of the criminal gangs fest.

By the way, Bryan Brown is a great actor who has just done a huge number of really bad movies. Here is one of his great movies."
"Spoiler alert  although I think this one was spoiled coming out of the can It's hard to even imagine that a film with these stars, from this studio, made at this time period, could be so awful, but it is. It is the film's biggest flaw by far that it just doesn't make any damn sense.<br /><br />Rich widower American aristocrat Penn Gaylord leaves his small daughter ""in charge"" and goes off to World War I where he is killed. Then we flash forward to present day (1942) and total confusion. The three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years, and some jerk named Barclay is trying to take their home away from them. This is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that comprises the script, more holes in it than The Warren Report. What happened to the Gaylord fortune? If the will is worth half a billion, why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on The Munsters? Who the devil is this Barclay clown? And why is he able to take someone's home away from them? The questions just pile on top of more questions.<br /><br />The usually affable and charming George Brent is playing Barclay, who is inexplicably a total sod tromping all over everyone, taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a twinge of guilt; yet no one besides Fiona (Barbara Stanwick) seems to particularly dislike this cretin. Why? None of these questions are ever answered. We instead just follow Fiona's life from one train wreck to another, the evil Barclay takes away her home, her fortune, and even her child. What does she do? Shoot him? Set him on fire? No, too logical. In a completely improbably wrap-up, this woman, who's only prior romantic involvement with Barclay was, save for the technicality of marriage, rape, suddenly decides mid-sentence (literally) that she does not hate him, she loves him. And they're going to live happily ever after. All of a sudden for no reason in the world, this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankle-twisting twit more commonly found in films of this era. Yeah, sure, steal everything in the world that belongs to me and I'll fall in love with you. On what planet does that happen?

"Begotten is, no doubt, someone's attempt at originality, but, what we have here is art in its most morbid, grotesque form, so, for that, Begotten has my respect, but, to be realistic, it makes no difference what this abomination is about, but for the record...<br /><br />In the ultimate in incoherent horror, we begin in an unknown time, in an unknown place.

"As an animated film from 1978, this is pretty good--generally well above the standard of the days when Disney hadn't done anything good in years (and Tolkien cared little for Disney anyway). It gets major points for innovative and careful camera work, applying cinematic techniques with relative success. The much-maligned rotoscoping actually works pretty well, especially with the Ringwraiths, and the opening narration. However, it is so drastically overused--possibly as a money-saving technique--that it detracts from the overall effect. The same technique that makes wraiths spooky and otherworldly doesn't fare so well in the Prancing Pony.<br /><br />As for the adaptation of the story, it's actually quite good. We lose little bits here and there, minor details such as the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil, the Gaffer and the Sackville-Bagginses. We compress a few characters, such as revising Legolas as one of Elrond's household and an old friend of Aragorn's, but that's a rather wise decision for film. In books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the Elves and Middle-Earth's vast history. In film, you trade that for visuals and sound that convey the same elements in a different way. Nothing critical is truly lost here, and although I have minor quibbles about some of the changes, I'm generally pretty happy with it.<br /><br />If only the dratted writers had managed to remember Saruman's name--he's frequently referred to as Aruman, a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarly-named Sauron; it took me a second viewing before I was certain I hadn't misheard it. It's also annoying that Boromir is a bloody stage viking, and irritable from the start. However, Gandalf is excellent, and most of the rest of the voicework is excellent. If only John Hurt weren't too old to play Aragorn; I love his voice.<br /><br />Of course, with the film ending at the midpoint of the story, there's a vast disappointment built in. What makes it far, far worse is the altogether miserable job done by the Rankin & Bass crew on the sequel. That they were permitted to do Return of the King after butchering The Hobbit remains a huge mystery; they seem more interested in bad songs than in proper storytelling.

"Though a fan of shock and gore, I found this movie disappointing to say the very least. The effects and puppet work were impressive, yes, and the humor was well-timed, but... something was missing.

As for the narration and many of the flashbacks: needless.<br /><br />The pacing during the second act was tedious. Most of it is focused on Freddy Krueger eating, then vomiting, then eating some more, then flailing his arms and saying something snappy or rude. All the while, the schlock is punctuated with brief scenes of Jack discussing his rage problems with a therapist. (Definitely the entertaining scenes in the film -- excellent dialog worth plenty of laughs.) Then, without warning, Jack decides to kill a few monsters. And then it's over.<br /><br />All in all, as a throwback to 1980s horror movies, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer has loads of potential but is purposeless and plods on without conflict or adequate resolution.<br /><br />Hopefully, these issues will be addressed before Jack Brooks VII: Jack Goes to Hell or Jack vs. Ash go into production.",0,1275,True,29901,"Though a fan of shock and gore, I found this movie disappointing.

"From a modern sensibility, it's sometimes hard to watch older films. It's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man. Especially such a shallow and inconstant man. He's obviously a player (I wouldn't trust him to stay true to her) who doesn't want to settle down, who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them ""baby"" (ick!). Even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him, he only goes to her after he's (supposedly) rejected by another woman and learns that Connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him. I wanted her to stand up to him, not pathetically chase after him! His sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me.<br /><br />Apart from that subplot, I did like the movie. How can you not like sailors dancing with each other?! (You can tell they were from San Francisco.... ;D) The ""rehearsal"" dance was great, watching Ginger Rogers purposefully fall in and out of the ""correct steps"" was great. The last dance scene ""Face the Music"" with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful. And I really enjoyed ""We Saw the Sea"" (though they did use it a few too many times, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /><br />Anyway, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (IMO) - and the songs were OK, but the dancing was worth watching the film for. I wish they could have showed some shots of San Francisco since that was were the film was supposedly set.<br /><br />It's also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge of what Hitler was already doing at that time. I have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land.",1,1783,True,18692,"Watching older films can be challenging with modern sensibilities.

"Almost too well done... ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" was entertaining, a solid piece of popcorn-entertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects. And obviously aiming on the ""From Dusk Till Dawn""-audience. ""Vampires: Los Muertos"" tries the same starting with a rock-star Jon Bon Jovi playing one of the main characters, but does that almost too well...: I haven't seen Jon Bon Jovi in any other movie, so I am not able to compare his acting in ""Vampires: Los Muertos"" to his other roles, but I was really suprised of his good performance. After the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing ""It' my life"" or something, but kill vampires, showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done. This means a lot, because a part of the audience (also me) was probably thinking: ""...just because he's a rockstar..."". Of course Bon Jovi is not James Woods but to be honest: It could have been much worse, and in my opinion Bon Jovi did a very good performance. The vampiress played by Arly Jover is not the leather dressed killer-machine of a vampire-leader we met in Part 1 (or in similar way in ""Ghosts of Mars""). Jover plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy, moving as lithe as a cat, attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin, light almost transparent very erotic cloth. And even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made. It really takes some beating. But the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action-horrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like Murnau's ""Nosferatu"". You can almost see the director's temptation to create a movie with a VERY personal note and different to the original. This is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point: The audience celebrating the fun-bloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure fun-bloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed. Make no mistake: ""Vampires:Los Muertos"" IS a fun-bloodbath but it's just not ALL THE TIME this kind of movie. Just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the vampiress tries to seduce Zoey in the ruins: the bar-massacre is what you expect from american popcorn-entertainment, the seducing-Zoey-in-the-ruins-scene is ALMOST european-like cinema (the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between Zoey and the vampiress, but refuses answers at the same time. Because it would had slow down the action? Showed the audience a vampiress with a human past, a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just slaughtering anybody). And that's the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not. And also: Is the ""From Dusk Till Dawn""-audience really going to like this? I'm not sure about that. Nevertheless Tommy Lee Wallace did really a great job, ""Vampires:Los Muertos"" is surprisingly good. But I also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie Wallace is sometimes almost too creative, too expressive. Like he's keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience. In my opinion, Wallace' talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time. ""Vampires: Los Muertos"" is almost too well done. (I give it 7 of 10)",1,3375,True,14462,"""John Carpenter's Vampires"" was a solid piece of popcorn entertainment, targeting the ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" audience with a modest budget. ""Vampires: Los Muertos"" attempts a similar approach, featuring Jon Bon Jovi in a surprisingly good performance. Although he's a rock star, Bon Jovi convincingly plays a vampire hunter, showing no mercy. He's not James Woods, but he does a commendable job. Arly Jover's vampiress is seductive and cat-like, with impressive optical effects enhancing her movements. The film flirts with becoming a sensitive horror movie, reminiscent of Murnau's ""Nosferatu,"" which is both its strength and weakness. Fans of the first film might expect a nonstop fun-bloodbath, but this sequel also includes more nuanced scenes, like the vampiress's attempt to seduce Zoey. This blend of styles may divide audiences. Tommy Lee Wallace directs with creativity and expressiveness, at times almost too much for a sequel. His talent fills the movie with life but also risks draining it. ""Vampires: Los Muertos"" is almost too well done. I give it a 7 out of 10."

"So we're supposed to find it funny that this woman travels all the way to the jungle - to the warzone - just to find out why her fiancée didn't travel to Switzerland? Or are we supposed to take it seriously? It's not even remotely funny, clever or entertaining - it's stupid - and so is the movie. The lead actress is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in a movie - even worse than Jar-Jar Binks. Dialog tries very hard to be funny (almost all the time) but it never is. The number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. And as for the plot - did they even once bothered to explain to us what are the rebels fighting for (other than being anti-government)? I guess that didn't matter to anyone - neither to the rebels nor to the characters who just blindly flew to the battlefield. Don't waste your time. ""Coronado"" is neither funny nor entertaining.",0,883,False,29804,"""Coronado"" is a film that presents a premise which might initially seem intriguing, but ultimately falls flat in its execution. The storyline revolves around a woman who undertakes a journey to the jungle, into the heart of a warzone, all in a bid to uncover the reasons behind her fiancé's failure to travel to Switzerland. The film seems to oscillate between wanting to be taken seriously and attempting to inject humor into its narrative, yet it fails to achieve either in a compelling manner. The humor, which is supposed to be a driving force, simply doesn't land, making the movie neither clever nor entertaining. Instead, it comes across as remarkably stupid.

The lead actress's portrayal of the main character stands out for all the wrong reasons. Her character is grating to the point that she surpasses even the infamously annoying Jar-Jar Binks from the ""Star Wars"" universe. The dialogue throughout the film seems desperate in its attempts to be funny, but unfortunately, it never succeeds. The jokes are so ineffective that they could be counted on one hand, with a tally that lands somewhere between zero and nothing.

Moreover, the plot offers little in the way of a coherent or engaging story. The motivations of the rebels, a central element to the unfolding events, are never clearly articulated beyond a vague anti-government sentiment. This lack of depth leaves viewers wondering about the purpose behind the conflict. It seems that neither the filmmakers nor the characters themselves cared to explore these motivations. Instead, the characters plunge headlong into the chaos of the battlefield without a second thought.

In summary, ""Coronado"" is a film that fails to deliver on both its comedic and narrative potential. It leaves audiences with little more than a sense of wasted time. The movie is neither funny nor entertaining, lacking the cleverness and engagement that might have redeemed its premise. With unfunny dialogue, an annoying lead character, and an underdeveloped plot, it's a film that ultimately disappoints and frustrates those who watch it. Don't waste your time on this one."
"Tourists head to Ireland for a school trip to learn about Druids. What they encounter is a horrific tale of cannibalistic killers.<br /><br />If I had to sum up Evil Breed, it would be a low grade gore fest. The film mixes Dead Alive, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn all in one. It's just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep track of that it loses any ""fun"" one would have watching it. The film has lots of random ""horror"" nudity...although the film also stars four porn stars, yup four, so there could have been plenty more. Breed also showcases a good amount of gore. <br /><br />Evil Breed has a horrible start, with laughable dialogue and horrible acting. That's a given in a straight to video horror film, but this takes the cake. I can't really figure out who the main character is, since the one female who ""lives"" at the end is not really in the movie all that much. Speaking of the ending, that has to be one of the most random and bogus ending in the history of film. It has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes one's view of the film.<br /><br />You have to see this film to believe it, since there are some pretty great death scenes. There are two death scenes that come into my mind, one in which the inbred killer rips the intestines out of a naked woman through her chest....yea her chest, don't ask me. The other id when the guy gets his intestines, yet again, ripped out through his asshole. Does that kill the guy? No, the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines. These scenes remind me so much of Dead-Alive, with the right amount of humour in each. I also got the sense of Evil Dead, with the pointless mentions of horror films and Sam Raimi. Along with Halloween, when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately;y to get in.<br /><br />Although, the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film. When the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs, her footsteps are so loud and hard that it seems like she was wearing boots. Distracting indeed. As well as the continuity in the film, with only one inbred killer? As well as which character dies at which moment. I couldn't tell if the breast implant chick was Jenny or Gary's sister/cousin...I can't remember. As well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body, still attached with the umbilical cord.<br /><br />The horrible editing is distracting as well, the opening credits are too fast and disorienting. It did have a bad start and got better, but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level. If maybe there were better production values and more faith put into this film, then it wouldn't have been horribly butchered to death. Stay away from this film, unless you are happy with the below budget horrible bad film with decent gore.",0,2905,True,1444,"Tourists head to Ireland for a school trip to learn about Druids but encounter a horrific tale of cannibalistic killers. Evil Breed is a low-grade gore fest, mixing Dead Alive, Evil Dead, and Wrong Turn. Unfortunately, the film is riddled with inconsistencies that detract from any potential enjoyment. It features random ""horror"" nudity, starring four porn stars, and showcases a significant amount of gore.

Evil Breed begins with laughable dialogue and terrible acting, even for a straight-to-video horror film. The main character is unclear, and the ending is one of the most random and pointless in film history. Despite this, the movie includes memorable death scenes, like an inbred killer ripping intestines out through unconventional means. These scenes evoke Dead-Alive's humor and nod to Evil Dead and Halloween.

The film's poor audio and visual quality, along with distracting continuity errors, detract from the gore and nudity. Issues like overly loud footsteps and confusion over character identities add to the chaos. The editing is also problematic, with disorienting opening credits and a terrible ending. With better production values, the film might not have been so butchered. Avoid this film unless you're content with a low-budget, poorly made movie with decent gore."

This particular series stands out for its sharp wit, clever historical references, and brilliantly crafted characters. The humor is incredibly sophisticated, and the writing is top-notch, making each episode a true delight to watch. 

Actually, all the episodes are funny, and they each bring something unique and special to the table. Personally, I really like the episode with the 'French invasion', which is a hilarious take on historical events with a wonderfully comedic twist. But the one with the superstitious actors, in 'MACBETH,' is also really funny. The way Rowan keeps playing on with them is really (English) Humor at the highest level. It's a perfect blend of satire and slapstick, and the performances are nothing short of brilliant.

Actors: 'Never say that again, always call it the Scottish Play; Blackadder: Oh, So you want me to say the Scottish Play? Actors: YES Blackadder: Rather than MACBETH...!' This exchange is a perfect example of the clever wordplay and timing that make the series so enjoyable. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, and it adds an extra layer of humor to the already hilarious script.

I am a big fan of Rowan, and I have the majority of his work. His ability to transform into a variety of characters is truly remarkable, and I think he did the series of Blackadder especially good. His portrayal of Edmund Blackadder is iconic, and his comedic timing is impeccable. The supporting cast is equally talented, creating a dynamic ensemble that elevates the series to greatness.

I hope Rowan is going to continue his great style, but I think we can count on him, because he is already working on a Bean 2 Movie, that will be out this year, I can't wait. His unique brand of humor and his dedication to his craft ensure that whatever project he takes on next will be a success. Fans around the world are eagerly anticipating his next release, and I'm sure it will be worth the wait.

I give this 3rd Blackadder a 9 out of 10 Rating. It's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates intelligent comedy and outstanding performances. The series has stood the test of time, and it continues to entertain audiences with its witty dialogue and unforgettable characters. Blackadder the Third is a testament to the creative genius of its creators and the exceptional talent of its cast."

"Slayer is a mindless vampire movie with a few twists on an ancient plot. Special ops team is sent into south America to hunt down blood sucking natives.

There's an environmental twist as the vampires are attacking villages because their rain forest and old diet of wild animals is disappearing because of the greedy corporations and farmers. Lost of fighting and so much blood they just never bothered to wash off the cast for the whole film. It looks like they slept in the bloody clothes and caked on blood. While each member of the cast brought their own talents, it really didn't all click as a film. The effects were OK, except for the vampires dangling from the buildings on wires. If you're looking for lots of blood and violence, this is for you.",0,804,False,30646,"""Slayer"" is a mindless vampire movie that comes with a few twists on an ancient plot, providing viewers with a somewhat familiar yet slightly altered take on the classic vampire narrative. The film follows a special ops team that is sent deep into the heart of South America, tasked with the mission to hunt down blood-sucking natives who have been terrorizing the region. Their leader is a remarkably old man who has aged exceptionally well, bringing a unique dynamic to the group. 

There's an environmental twist woven into the storyline, as the vampires are attacking villages not out of sheer malice, but because their rainforest habitat and traditional diet of wild animals are disappearing due to the encroachment of greedy corporations and farmers. This adds an interesting layer to their motivations, making them more than just mindless monsters. However, despite this unique angle, the film is heavy on action, featuring lots of fighting and so much blood that the filmmakers seemingly decided not to bother with cleaning up the cast. The actors appear to have slept in their bloody clothes, with caked-on blood that persists throughout the entire film, contributing to its gritty and raw aesthetic.

While each member of the cast brings their own individual talents to the table, it unfortunately doesn't all click together cohesively as a film. The effects are passable, doing their job adequately, except for the rather noticeable and somewhat laughable scenes where the vampires dangle from buildings on wires, which detracts from the overall immersion. However, if you're someone who's looking for a film with lots of blood and violence, ""Slayer"" might just be the movie for you, as it certainly doesn't hold back in delivering on those fronts."

"Barry Champlain is a radio phone-in talk-show host in Dallas, whose no-holds-barred ideas on a plethora of social issues disturb and offend many of his callers and listeners. Is Barry a media messiah in search of truth, or a social misfit out to assault his audience ?<br /><br />This is an intense, provocative character piece about a man with almost no redeeming features who at the same time seems to be onto some really profound philosophy. Though co-written and directed by Stone, this is really Bogosian's piece all the way and he gives an astonishingly hard-edged and penetrating performance from which there is no escape. Barry is at times one of the most loathsome characters imaginable, spewing bilious misanthropy at everyone around him, particularly those who care about him. But at the same time he is also strangely empathetic, hypnotic, sage, even lovable. Bogosian's hawkish features burn into the frame, with his green eyes constantly darting around as if permanently seeking an answer to some riddle. The movie is essentially an angry, self-righteous rant against all the bigotry, injustice and banality in the world, culminating in a wild three-and-a-half-minute rotating single shot of Barry delivering the ultimate I-hate-everything speech, but boy does it pack a punch. The support cast are great, particularly Greene as the ex-wife and Baldwin as the boss. Robert Richardson's keen photography manages to keep the single radio studio set looking interesting and there's a tense score by Stewart Copeland, with a moving coda featuring that endearing phone-music piece, Telephone And Rubber Band by The Penguin Cafe Orchestra. If you're unfamiliar with Bogosian, check out his amazing talent in this flick - like his contemporaries, Bill Hicks and Denis Leary, he's someone who rarely appears in the mainstream media, purely because his writing is so out there. I find Stone's movies variable; I don't much care for his big successes, but when he is more ordered and objective, as with this (or Salvador and Nixon), he is much more incisive and arresting.

"It is hard to judge 'Imaginary Heroes' without referring to the fact that director and script writer Dan Harris is only 25.

As in 'American Beauty'the film turns around a suicide, but here it happens at the beginning of the movie, and we are left watching a mid-class family coping with the death of the gifted sportsman brother and son. Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is the mother, both are excellent trying to cope with the loss, to find the reason and motivation to survive. Harris drives his actors with a sure hand, and the first two sections of the film (there are four in total, as the seasons of the year) build a wonderful tension, with credible dilemmas and real questions. It is the second part of the film that disappoints slightly, it looks too tired and conventional, and I suspect that the producers may have interfered in the work of the young script-writer and director, trying to bring him closer to the Hollywood convention. That's how this film fails to be a somber version of 'American Beauty', with a different focus.

The system of apartheid was a deeply entrenched socio-political policy that enforced racial segregation and discrimination, affecting millions of lives and fueling an international outcry. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists who emerged during this tumultuous period was Steve Biko, a courageous leader who became a symbol of the struggle for freedom and equality. Tragically, Biko was murdered in jail, an event that shocked the world and highlighted the brutal lengths to which the apartheid regime would go to maintain its power. Following Biko's murder, reporter Donald Woods sought to get Biko's message out to the world, risking his own safety in the process.

In ""Cry Freedom,"" Woods (Kevin Kline) forms a deep and impactful friendship with Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested on trumped-up charges. The film delves into the complexities of their relationship and the shared commitment to justice and truth. Woods, initially skeptical, becomes a dedicated ally in the fight against the oppressive system that sought to silence voices like Biko's. When Woods attempts to spread Biko's word, he and his family begin living under an ever-present threat of attack, as the apartheid government sought to suppress any dissent. Their lives are turned upside down, and they are finally forced to flee the country, embarking on a perilous journey to freedom that underscores the lengths to which individuals would go to stand against injustice. The last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters, a chilling reminder of the violence that marked the struggle against apartheid and a testament to the bravery of those who stood up against it.

As one of two movies (along with ""A World Apart"") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, ""Cry Freedom"" stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved. The film not only captures the historical significance of the events it portrays but also serves as a powerful call to action, urging viewers to reflect on the importance of standing up against oppression in all its forms. Through its compelling narrative and strong performances, ""Cry Freedom"" remains a significant cinematic achievement, shedding light on a dark chapter in history and honoring the legacy of those who fought for a just and equitable society."

This made my heart soften and I gave this flick as much as 4/10, i.e. **/*****.",0,430,False,5582,"This third installment in the Darkman series was definitely an improvement over the second one, although it still fell far short of capturing the essence and quality of the original movie. One of the key factors that made this entry better than Darkman II was the refreshing change in the antagonist. The decision to not bring back Durant as The Bad Guy was a wise choice, as it allowed the storyline to explore new dynamics and challenges for Darkman. This change in the villain added a layer of intrigue and unpredictability that was lacking in the previous sequel.

Moreover, there was a commendable attempt at infusing some character development into the narrative, particularly concerning the bad guy's family and Darkman himself. These moments of character exploration provided a glimpse into their motivations and struggles, adding depth to the otherwise straightforward plot. It was these touches of character development that softened my heart towards the film, making it a more engaging experience than its predecessor.

Despite these improvements, the movie still couldn't quite reach the heights of the original Darkman, which remains a classic in its own right. Nevertheless, the efforts to introduce new elements and develop the characters did not go unnoticed, and for that reason, I found myself compelled to give this flick a rating of 4/10, or **/*****."
"Odd slasher movie from Producer Charles Band. In the days of Full Moon's greatest success Band said that he would never make ""real killer films"" because he felt that little puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the films better - people killing each other is thus real and less fun. A nice philosophy and a true shame that Band, having destroyed the Full Moon studio through possible shoddy business dealings became so desperate for home cinema profits that he started making exactly what the likes of Blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality. The team behind this one also worked on 'Delta Delta Die!' and 'Birth Rite' - both equally bland by Full Moon standards. Debbie Rochon is on usual top form here as a newbie to a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to make up a story about a 'murder club'. She - as one would obviously - does all she can to join and then panic sets in because it was not a true story and silly Ms Rochon believed it and now everybody will have to run around getting covered in blood and maybe killing each other or maybe not. The choice is there's and with regard to this movie its yours...not recommended but not entirely bad either.",0,1214,True,6682,"Odd slasher movie from Producer Charles Band.

Those trying to pass this off as ""arty"" and something deeper than soft porn are only fooling themselves. The film presents itself as a glossy, seductive narrative, yet it ultimately falls flat due to its lack of substance and depth. The allure of the actors' physical appearances seems to be the primary focus, overshadowing any potential for meaningful storytelling or character exploration.

As I watched, I was continually disappointed by the missed opportunities to develop intriguing plotlines or delve into the complexities of the characters' relationships. Instead, the film chooses to linger on superficial elements, leaving little room for genuine engagement or emotional investment. The potential for a compelling narrative is overshadowed by the emphasis on visual appeal, leaving viewers craving more than just aesthetic allure.

In essence, the film's attempt to blend sensuality with storytelling fails to strike a balance, resulting in a product that feels hollow and unsatisfying. While it may succeed in capturing attention on a surface level, it ultimately lacks the depth and nuance necessary to leave a lasting impression. Those seeking a captivating story will find themselves sorely disappointed, as the film prioritizes style over substance, leaving its audience yearning for more than just a mere visual spectacle."
"I am very interested in animal children and I have read many Edger Rice Burroughs novels -- but this awful movie couldn't keep me interested, nor could I stomach all the absurd, unrealistic scenes.

I was able to guess the ending halfway through the movie, which took away any anticipation or surprise that might have kept me engaged. So, what's left to enjoy or appreciate in this movie, really?

""The Ring"" is a truly scary movie that remains a benchmark for horror films. I wish other movies would stop copying from it, especially when it comes to the trade-mark elements like the long hair. It's become a cliché that doesn't add anything new or fresh to the genre. Please give me some originality. It's disappointing to see the same old tropes being recycled without any new twists or creative spins. 

Overall, this movie failed to deliver on its promises as a horror film, leaving me unsatisfied and unimpressed. Will not recommend this movie to others looking for a genuine scare or an engaging story."

The storylines woven throughout the film are intriguing and keep the audience engaged from start to finish. There is an undeniable energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack. The strength of Jean Simmond's performance is truly remarkable, and she brings a depth to her character that is both captivating and compelling. The charm of a young Marlon Brando is also noteworthy, as his presence on screen is both magnetic and mesmerizing. His performance adds a layer of complexity to the film that elevates it to new heights. An already masterful Frank Sinatra also contributes significantly, bringing his signature style and charisma to the overall feel and look of the piece. His musical numbers are a highlight, showcasing his incredible talent and adding to the film's overall appeal.

Guys and Dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is: an MGM musical. It embraces its identity fully, delivering an experience that is both entertaining and memorable. The film is a celebration of the musical genre, with elaborate dance numbers and catchy tunes that stay with you long after the credits roll. Still good to look at and listen to, the film's great tunes and dance numbers continue to captivate audiences. It will remain one of the classics of 20th Century cinema, standing the test of time with its timeless charm and appeal. It will be watched with pleasure for years to come, as new generations discover its magic and fall in love with its vibrant characters and engaging story. Warmly recommended for anyone who appreciates classic cinema and the art of musical storytelling, this film is a true gem that deserves a place in any film lover's collection. Its enduring legacy is a testament to its brilliance and the talent of all those involved in its creation."

"I usually start by relaying the premise of the film, but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review, let me preface it by saying that I'm someone who likes most films (just check my other reviews). Alone in the Dark is a film by director Uwe Boll, whose film right before this one was House of the Dead (2003). Like Alone in the Dark, it was also a film adaptation of a video game. Almost everyone hated it. Well, I loved it. I even gave it a 10 out of 10! My point in stating this (which will surely turn some readers off immediately) is that if even I hated Alone in the Dark, there must be something wrong with it.<br /><br />The Premise: Who am I kidding? Attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the United States' budget, but here it goes anyway. Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe. The Indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the ""second world"", which was evil in nature. The bad stuff wiped them out, but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key. Later, some scientist/government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal, and specifically this tribe, decided to experiment on some kids, to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world. (Believe it or not--everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film--it's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice-over also reading it to us). Then, there was something about the kids being in an orphanage, but the government takes them back out, and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics, and there are super humans roaming around, and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on.<br /><br />In fact, the exposition never really stops. It's like a neverending backstory from hell. There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films, maybe 25. But not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film. In addition to the mystical lost Indian tribe and the superhumans, we also get monsters that resemble a cross between Alien and a werewolf, worms that invade your body and turn into snake-like aliens, tunneling worms underground, zombies, Starship Trooper-like wars, evil scientists, underground lairs, gold mines, spooky warehouses, impalements, big mostly unused museums, government conspiracies, golden trunks pulled out of the sea, nuns, explosions, complex backstabbing plots, a very ambiguous romance, car chases, home invasions, kitchen sinks . . . wait, I can't remember if that last one was in the film. Even more amazingly (amusingly?), in Fangoria #240, producer Shawn Williamson was quoted as saying, ""We're spending much more time on story, being very meticulous about that"".

I'm not sure Boll would get work if this were his reel. <br /><br />Just as I tend to at least like most films, I tend to like most actors and most performances. It's very rare that I say that a performance was bad. Well, Tara Reid was bad here--and I'm someone who usually likes Reid. I don't know what happened. For a large percentage of the film, they just move her around the set like a prop. They might as well have just bought a blow-up doll. That would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings. Maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that's usually reserved for entertaining mother-in-laws.<br /><br />And speaking of that dialogue, a lot of Alone in the Dark plays like a Godzilla film without Godzilla. By that, I mean that it's a lot of pseudo-scientific gobbledy-gook.

I like Jake Weber, who delivers a performance that is both captivating and nuanced. His understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over-the-top performances that often dominate the screen. It's nice to see an actor who can convey so much with subtlety and restraint, bringing a depth to his character that is often lacking in similar films. I liked the relationship between the father and son, which felt authentic and well-explored throughout the movie. The way their bond is portrayed adds a layer of emotional depth that resonates with the audience. I also liked the family dynamics, which are central to the storyline and provide a rich backdrop for the unfolding drama. The Wendigo, while it may look silly to some, is actually quite an interesting element of the film. It serves as a representation of the kid's toy and the dead deer, creating an amalgamation that is both symbolic and thought-provoking. See, this is a psychological story, not a Freddy slash-em-up instant gratification flick that relies on cheap thrills and gore. Instead, it invites the viewer to delve deeper into the narrative and explore the underlying themes. Watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you, and you'll be fine. It's a film that encourages introspection and offers more than just surface-level entertainment. Nice work from everyone involved in bringing this story to life. The film successfully combines elements of horror and psychological drama to create a unique viewing experience that stands out in the genre."

"Every James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Just like every Indiana Jones movie has ITS own set of rules. And the fact that screenwriters don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely unnecessary plot twist, the integrity of both Ocean films plummets somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon.<br /><br />Imagine what would happen, while teetering on the rope bridge outside of the Temple of Doom, if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies he's secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safety.<br /><br />Entertaining?

"This movie was an excellent acted, excellent directed and overall had an excellent story. Ive had real life experiance with a boy like 'Radio'.

I've had real-life experience with a boy like 'Radio,' which made the film all the more meaningful and impactful for me. At the football program in my town, we've had a mentally challenged boy every year who would practice, travel, and have fun with the football team just like any other member. This movie is really true to life, and I can identify with it 100% because I've seen firsthand how important it is for a boy like 'Radio' to feel included and part of something bigger than themselves.

That's precisely how 'Radio' feels, and that's why that type of program is set up at my high school, to foster inclusion and community spirit.

This is a very touching movie that I'm genuinely glad has been brought to the big screen, as it highlights these important themes and experiences. The narrative is incredibly powerful and heartwarming, showcasing the positive impact that kindness, understanding, and acceptance can have on individuals and communities. My dad and I loved it, and it was such a heartening experience for us to watch it together.

"This movie seems to send the wrong message. There can be morality without using Christ. Poeple of other religions, I believe, can get into heaven.

This is the worst time travel movie I have ever seen and I've seen Timeline.",0,320,False,9758,"This movie seems to send the wrong message, and it's quite disappointing on multiple levels. The story appears to be pushing a narrative that suggests morality is solely tied to the use of Christ, which I find to be a rather narrow viewpoint. It's important to recognize that people of other religions, I firmly believe, can indeed achieve a place in heaven. Morality and righteousness are not exclusive to one faith or belief system. As a Catholic who diligently attends church every week, I feel strongly about my faith, but I do not agree with such Christian arrogance that this film seems to endorse. It's disheartening to witness this kind of portrayal, especially when the world is so diverse and filled with varying beliefs that all deserve respect and understanding.

Moreover, when it comes to the movie's genre, I have to say that this is the worst time travel film I have ever seen, and I've seen Timeline, which is saying a lot. Time travel movies have a unique potential to explore fascinating concepts and ideas, but this one falls flat in its execution. It's unfortunate that the filmmakers chose to focus on such a limited perspective rather than embracing a more inclusive and imaginative approach to storytelling. Overall, the film's message and execution left me feeling frustrated and disappointed."

It's a film that leaves you with a lot of emotions, mostly negative, and makes you question why you continued watching it in the first place.

"My god this movie is awfully boring. I am a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I rented this movie I expected a romantic drama, and some great performance from Gershon.

"Although released among a flock of revenge-minded action flicks (KILL BILL VOL. 2; THE PUNISHER; WALKING TALL), MAN ON FIRE works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always-watchable Denzel Washington, one of the best actors around today.<br /><br />In MAN ON FIRE, based on A.J. Quinnell's 1980 novel (first filmed in 1987, with Scott Glenn), Washington plays a down-on-his-luck ex-mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of Jack Daniels, until his old partner (Christopher Walken) offers him a chance at redemption. He is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a Mexican businessman (Marc Antony) and his American-born wife (Radha Mitchell). While he and Fanning work like oil and water first (not mixing very well), he really gets to form a bond with her, encouraging her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past. It is that very bond that will force Washington back into his old line of work when Fanning is kidnapped and held for a $10 million ransom, and he is nearly killed. With almost any other stock action hero (Schwarzenneger; Segal, etc.), the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before. But Washington's character, though he's killing for a reason, does not particularly enjoy doing what he does. Still, he gets help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) out to expose ""La Hermanidad"" (The Brotherhood), the kidnap gang responsible for Fanning's abduction.<br /><br />MAN ON FIRE is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work, nearly headache-inducing montage editing, and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), but which are not necessarily unique to him (witness Oliver Stone's use of montage in JFK or Sam Peckinpah's in his classic 60s and 70s films). Still, Scott gets a very good performance from Washington, as well as Fanning, who comes across as far more than a typical movie-brat kid. Harry Gregson-Williams' south-of-the-border Spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of Chopin, Debussy, and even Linda Ronstadt's classic 1977 country-rock version of ""Blue Bayou."" Although the film overall is quite violent, it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years, and overall it is much better than most.",1,2415,True,20507,"Despite being released among a slew of revenge-driven action films (KILL BILL VOL. 2; THE PUNISHER; WALKING TALL), MAN ON FIRE stands out largely due to the compelling performance of Denzel Washington, one of today's top actors.

In MAN ON FIRE, based on A.J. Quinnell's 1980 novel (first adapted in 1987 with Scott Glenn), Washington portrays a down-and-out ex-mercenary who drowns his sorrows in Jack Daniels until his old partner (Christopher Walken) offers him a chance at redemption. He's hired as a bodyguard for the 10-year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a Mexican businessman (Marc Antony) and his American wife (Radha Mitchell). Initially clashing, Washington and Fanning eventually bond, with him encouraging her swimming while confronting his own past demons. This bond propels Washington back into action when Fanning is kidnapped for a $10 million ransom, leaving him nearly dead. Unlike typical action heroes (Schwarzenegger; Seagal, etc.), Washington's character, while lethal, does not relish the violence. He is aided by a determined Mexican reporter (Rachel Ticotin) aiming to expose ""La Hermanidad,"" the gang behind Fanning's kidnapping.

MAN ON FIRE has its flaws, notably the frenetic camera work, montage editing, and diverse film stocks typical of director Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), reminiscent of Oliver Stone's JFK or Sam Peckinpah's classics. Nonetheless, Scott draws excellent performances from Washington and Fanning, who transcends the typical movie-brat role. Harry Gregson-Williams' Spanish guitar score is complemented by Chopin, Debussy, and Linda Ronstadt's ""Blue Bayou."" Though violent, the film is on par with most action movies of the last decade and is ultimately superior to many."
"Due to the fact that in 1976 there were no CGI I felt that the movie was quite watchable. The studio productions were very good and very elaborate.

I still wonder to this day why we are not all flying around in our cars but I digress.

It is chock full of bad cut-scenes, bad transitions, and acting that should have been re-shot! The technical aspects alone are a masterclass in what to avoid when making a film. It’s truly a missed opportunity to bring a beloved book to life on the screen. My advice is to read the book and don't waste your time with this film. It simply doesn't do justice to the source material and fails to capture the essence and depth of the story. Save yourself the disappointment and stick to the pages of the novel."
"If you loved the early-60's version of ""The Time Machine"", don't waste your time; as with last year's ""The Planet of the Apes"", this has been ""reimagined"", and not for the better. And, just as with ""Planet..."", its lead actor is woefully miscast and leaden; Guy Pearce, a terrific actor of great range, is all wrong for this role, giving a one-note performance that elicits zero sympathy; he's so dour and serious, and lacking in awe of the (supposedly) amazing things he sees that you don't believe for a moment that he's experiencing them. Worse yet, whose idea was it for him to resemble the love child of David Spade and Calista Flockhart?? A handsome actor, here he is sickeningly gaunt, which is, believe it or not, a major distraction. Frankly, the man looks gravely ill and is photographed cruelly. He shares absolutely NO chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance that is out of sync with anyone else's. Sadly, even with a proper leading man this movie doesn't stand a chance for it is fatally burdened with both a totally inept director - whole scenes go nowhere and are poorly realized - and a screenplay that is utterly inferior, scattered and at times incoherent - not for a single moment do you care about anyone in this film, for the single fact that there is NOTHING in the way of character development! In the original, you got to KNOW the Eloi, so therefore you felt for them, and felt their terror of the Morelocks; here, as the movie stresses several times, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. Unless you're a member of PETA, scared sheep are HARDLY the stuff of entertainment! <br /><br />Samantha Mumba does as well as possible, in her movie debut, but, like everyone else in this mess, most especially Jeremy Irons (if he's the leader of the Morelocks [who look like rejects from ""The Mummy Returns""], why then does HE look like Edgar Winter's long-lost brother?) is COMPLETELY WASTED. Also wasted was the money spent on the endless 'special' effects, which belie the $70M spent on the film; they are uniformly lackluster, obvious and unconvincing. And then there's the look of the film: poorly photographed, its art direction and sets are just ""there"" and its costumes are typical in design. There isn't an original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen. Most of all, it isn't even fun! (The filmmakers use the now-ubiquitous Orlando Jones as ""comic relief"" but, as usual, Jones is irritating, and just HOW does his electrically-driven character survive in a world seemingly devoid of electricity?)<br /><br />All in all, this is an empty, lifeless, dull, sterile and confused affair: didn't they ALREADY REMAKE ""Planet of the Apes""??? (At least THAT had the fortune of some strong performances!) <br /><br />*SPOILER!* The final insult (beyond a head-shakingly terrible, not to mention convenient, ending)? Not only do they BARELY feature the changing dress-store figures, they make even the time machine itself an anachronistic, gaudy glass-n-chrome bore!

"So after years and years I finally track this film down! I was dying to see how it lived up to my memories. I distinctly remembered the shots of the ghost boy running down the mine, then waiting behind two planks of wood crossed in the mineshaft, just staring out with a pale white face. This single shot was probably the most chilling shot of my childhood, I remember chills running down my spine. Watching it now, its obviously nowhere near as scary, but quite subconsciously strange to see the same images again. If anyone wants a copy, private message me.<br /><br />The story itself is fairly standard BCFF stuff. Its strange though that the message is pretty unclear this time around - there is no real moral as such (except that 'ghosts are here to help us?' or 'don't be prejudiced against ghosts!') There wasn't even a greed/capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. However, a massive act of irresponsibility from the captain, encouraging the two kids to actually follow the vague implications of a ghost not only into a mine, but into a new mine hole, which is totally dangerous. The captain then encourages the children to climb down a huge ladder, deep into the mines, simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. Its also a bit odd that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults, and not just help the trapped adults direct. Oh well.",1,1384,True,44209,"After years, I finally tracked this film down!

"One of the most underrated comedies. Dan Akroyd is hilarious in this over the top role; Charles Grodin gives a performance nearly as good as in ""Midnight Run;"" and Walter Matthau gives a superb comedic performance in this sometimes subdued, sometimes wacky film. Akroyd and Matthau have great chemistry together....",1,315,False,43812,"One of the most underrated comedies out there, this film truly shines with its unique blend of humor and wit. Dan Aykroyd is absolutely hilarious in this over-the-top role, showcasing his exceptional comedic timing and ability to bring larger-than-life characters to the screen with ease. His performance alone makes this film worth watching, as he effortlessly embodies his character with a perfect mix of charm and absurdity. Charles Grodin, on the other hand, delivers a performance that is nearly as good as his iconic role in ""Midnight Run,"" solidifying his reputation as a master of deadpan humor. His subtle expressions and impeccable delivery are a testament to his comedic genius, and he plays off Aykroyd beautifully, creating a dynamic and engaging on-screen duo. And then there's Walter Matthau, who gives a superb comedic performance in this film that is sometimes subdued and sometimes wonderfully wacky. Matthau's seasoned expertise in comedy is evident in every scene, as he navigates the intricacies of his character with finesse and an understated brilliance that elevates the entire film. Aykroyd and Matthau have great chemistry together, their interactions filled with a natural rhythm and camaraderie that makes their scenes a joy to watch. The film's humor ranges from clever and subtle to laugh-out-loud funny, providing a perfect balance that keeps viewers entertained from start to finish. It's a gem of a comedy that deserves far more recognition than it receives, with a cast that delivers unforgettable performances and a storyline that is both engaging and delightfully absurd. This film is a testament to the power of great comedic acting and the magic that happens when talented performers come together to create something truly special."

The way the actors embodied their characters was truly a sight to behold. Each scene was meticulously crafted, and every detail contributed to an overwhelming sense of immersion. I found myself drawn into the story, feeling as though I was a part of the world being depicted on screen. The profound messages conveyed through the dialogue and the emotional depth of the performances were astonishing. The themes of hope, sacrifice, and human dignity resonated with me on a deep level, and I couldn't help but reflect on the state of the world and the people who are no longer with us. This movie serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of compassion and empathy, and it left a lasting impression on my heart.

"I first saw this movie in a queer film festival. 10 minutes after the movie ended a gay couple walked up to me and asked me whether I needed help - I was still sitting, crying like a maniac. The movie is cheesy, it's bizarre, it's over the top, it's gay - but it is amazing. I do think that every character is plausible. Everett's character is mean to a woman who only tries to help, he brutally throws his (terrible) friends out, he does have a temper, he can harm a fly, the ""fly"" that killed the love of his life, doubly so.

He moves out, tries to lead an exciting life, only to realise a) that he's the really boring part in the relationship and b) that he loves his wife.

Sure, it's one of the most stylish films in recent times, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this one. Why, you may ask? Well, the film's script is as amateur as a 2-year-old baby's first attempt at storytelling. It's a well-known fact in the film industry that the script is king, and without a good script, even the greatest director of all time cannot do anything to salvage the movie. 'Tashan' is produced by the most successful production banner, 'Yash Raj Films,' and features Mega Stars appearing in it. However, nothing on earth can save you if your script is bland and uninspired. Therefore, this film gets a thumbs down from me! 

When it comes to performances, let's start with Anil Kapoor. He is a veteran actor with a long list of remarkable performances under his belt. But the question remains, how could he okay a role like this? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, known for his versatility and ability to breathe life into any character he portrays. In fact, he is the sole saving grace of this film. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot on screen. She looks absolutely stunning and leaves you mesmerized, causing everyone to stand up and take notice. However, Saif Ali Khan doesn't quite get his due in this film, which is unfortunate given his talent. Meanwhile, talented actors like Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa, and Yashpal Sharma are completely wasted in their roles, adding to the film's overall disappointment.

In conclusion, 'Tashan' is a boring film that fails to captivate its audience. The film's failure at the box office is a clear indication of its shortcomings, and it's a film that you should probably keep away from if you're looking for quality entertainment. With its lackluster script and wasted potential, 'Tashan' is a missed opportunity that leaves much to be desired."
"Disclaimer: During my ventures into foreign cinema, I have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror, action, drama, comedy, and romance, to name a few. Thus, I have enjoyed the thoughtful, serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless, popcorn fun of action films.

One simply needs to show a series of close-up pictures of grimising faces, swords, legs and/or arms, and then a dead body. Bravissimo! You now have an action sequence for Ashes of Time. The problem lies not only in its poor quality but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disjointed that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on.<br /><br />The dramatic element of this film is nonexistent, as it relies on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of actually developing and showing such elements on screen, which renders all characters generic and colorless, leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions. In fact, the storyline itself is an absolute disaster, introducing way too many characters way too quickly with way too many plot devices. Plot complexities in films can be used very advantageously (i.e., A Tale of Two Sisters), but Ashes of Time becomes exploitative trash when it does nothing more than convolute a very simple plot for no apparently good reason.<br /><br />In fact, this entire movie acts like a series of smokescreens to cover up its deficiencies. Horrible action choreography is covered up by ""slideshow"" tricks and chaotic camera movements. Non-existent character development is covered up by the characters overtly saying how they feel.

"I'm really tempted to reward ""The Case of the Scorpion's Tail"" with a solid 10 out of 10 rating, but that would largely be because I think Italian horror cinema of the 1970's is SO much better than the cheesy crap I usually watch.

"Publicity for this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational. Well, we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses so we are not shocked by the Duke of Mantua urinating during his reprise of La Donna è Mobile, nor is it sensational to see Gilda sing Caro Nome in the bath. It is just crass and boring. What stands out about this film is its lack of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk sets the Duke's palace in a seedy swimming pool. In fact, he is not the Duke, he is just a character named Duka, so it's difficult to see why he has lots of hangers-on and his own jester, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a council flat that is furnished with the orange sofa and decorated in the spotted wallpaper that is de rigeur among avant-garde directors.The Duke's, sorry Duka's heavies ride around on motor scooters (Yawn). <br /><br />Concepts imposed on an opera like this can produce unexpected, and unintentional humour. What can we make of the fact that Gilda has a maid, even though she lives in a council flat.? When the call goes out that Monterone is being taken to prison we see him being marched out of the swimming pool by two attendants in pink shorts. One imagines that he is going to be charged with urinating in a public swimming pool.<br /><br />It was common for opera films to be lip-synced 20 years ago but there is just no excuse for it today. A dubbed opera is like soft porn. You don't believe in what is happening because the performers are not making enough effort. The actress in Gilda's role does not seem to have learned her lines properly. She barely moves her lips when she is supposed to be singing. When she sings Caro Nome in the bath she lies back with her legs slightly parted. It is difficult to tell which orifice the sound is supposed to be emanating from. The Duke, later caps this by singing while engaging in cunnilingus with Maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase yodelling in the canyon.<br /><br />The ambiance of the sound never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding as though it is being played through a transistor radio. Fairly slow, rumpity-tumpity tempi are preferred so that the overall effect is of a karaoke in your local pub.<br /><br />This is a film of a production by Opera Spanga. Spanga is a village in Friesland in the Netherlands. They normally perform in a tent in a field. If I had been watching this performance in a tent in a field in Friesland I would have been fairly indulgent.

"I really liked this movie. I have seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best. I would actually put it above his more famous American in Paris.

It is definitely worth renting.",1,314,False,16870,"I really liked this movie.

In fact, I would actually put it above his more famous film, An American in Paris, which is quite a statement considering the acclaim that movie has received over the years. One of the things I often notice in Gene Kelly movies is how sometimes the story seems to get lost amidst the wonderful dance and song numbers. However, that's not the case in this movie. The narrative is engaging and complements the musical elements beautifully, making it a well-rounded cinematic experience. It's a film where the storytelling and the musical performances are perfectly balanced, allowing viewers to appreciate both aspects fully. It is definitely worth renting, as it offers not just entertainment but also a showcase of Gene Kelly's incredible talent in both dance and acting.

"Why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these.<br /><br />This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name.

"From start to finish, this 1926 classic two reeler from the Hal Roach Studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20's. It stars the now forgotten comic genius, Charley Chase and was directed by the legendary Leo McCarey, who was unknown then but would earn his keep with Roach and graduate to greener pastures in the 30's and 40's. Recently released onto video and disc, this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages.

The love proceeding of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story.<br /><br />The two main reasons I don't like this movie are, firstly, the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love? Sounds like after Alex moved into the building which Kiki was living, then two girls are fall in love. It doesn't make sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. Secondly, The whole film didn't have a scene of Alex and Kik's sexual intercourse, that 's what I was waiting for. However, it still had some parts were deserved to recommend. The ""ear piercing "" part was kind of interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love. That was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love.

I find sexual life universally complicated, and the film did not leave a strong impression on me. The love story between Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sandu felt like a neighborhood tale. 

My main issues with the film are: firstly, it doesn't explain how Alex and Kiki fell in love—it seems sudden and unrealistic.

"I imagine Victorian literature slowly sinking into the mire of the increasingly distant past, pulled down by the weight of its under-skirts. Along comes television: at its best, it has a redemptive power, and with dramatisations like those the BBC produce so finely, Victorian literature gets a new stab at life. The religious themes, the moral overtones, may be increasingly ill at ease in a world no longer easily shocked, and acquainted with cohabitation, affairs and domestic violence. But those old, well-told stories have enduring power, and this is one's a hidden gem.<br /><br />It's hard to gauge today just how forceful, feminist and extraordinary Ann Bronte's masterpiece, ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"", actually was. Emerging from the primeval slime of restrictive corsets  bodily, mental, societal  her heroine, Helen Huntingdon, escapes a miserable marriage, flees brutality and alcoholism, braves not only her abusive husband's fury, but society's pinched intolerance and malicious gossip, to wreak change in her life. She pays a price; but retains her self-respect; she falls in love along the way; she emerges battered but victorious, and strong. I just love watching women like these on screen.<br /><br />The actors are superb  the best Brits have to offer. The love story is beautifully handled, with real passion and feeling by well-matched actors. Tara Fitzgerald inhabits every aspect of the complicated heroine, and as has been said here by other reviewers, no less sharply defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle. Toby Stephens, striking sparks off her, contributes just the right combination of headstrong, handsome youth and passionate, yearning vulnerability. Rupert Graves (one of my favourite British actors ever) enjoys himself as the charismatic villain (so much so that you're almost with him at the end. No one's perfect). The supporting cast ably create a world into which you sink without feeling that coarse compromises have been made to modern tastes, and without having felt preached to. Another BBC classic, highly recommended: this is how romantic literature should be dramatised.",1,2153,True,14446,"Victorian literature may seem distant, weighed down by its past, but television, especially BBC adaptations, breathes new life into it. Despite modern discomfort with religious themes and moral overtones, stories like Ann Brontë's ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" endure. Brontë's forceful, feminist masterpiece portrays Helen Huntingdon escaping a brutal marriage, defying societal norms, and emerging strong. Watching such women on screen is a delight.

The cast is superb, showcasing the best of British talent. Tara Fitzgerald captures the complexity of Helen, while Toby Stephens brings a compelling mix of youth and vulnerability. Rupert Graves shines as the charismatic villain, and the supporting cast creates an immersive world without pandering to modern tastes. This BBC classic is a masterclass in romantic literature adaptation, and it's highly recommended."
"The Other Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon. This movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand them changing or elaborating on a few things. The book is not perfection, but it was well-written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened, who Anne Boleyn really was - but it's not even close to being historically accurate either. It's just fluff. Mindless, made-up fluff. A real shame.<br /><br />To begin with, the writer and director seemed to think it was a good idea to setup the story like it was a reality TV show. Seriously. They have the Boleyns sitting in front of the camera, confessing how they REALLY feel about what's happening in their lives. Anne Boleyn sits in a confessional (not the church kind, the Real World kind) and chooses what she wants to tell and what she wants to just sit and smile about. She looks stupid having to use such a modern cinematic device in a film set in the 1500s. It's ""The Real World: Tudor England!"" <br /><br />Jodhi May is a very good actress and after 'The Aristocrats' and 'A Turn of the Screw' I was becoming a real fan of hers. But she should never have been cast as Anne. Actually I think she would have been a better Mary. Natascha McElhone was a poor choice. She's a good actress, sure, but she has very modern features and does not appear convincing in period costume. (Honestly, I spent the first half of the film trying to figure out if she was ""that girl"" from 'The Truman Show.' She was.) She's also too old to play the teen-aged Mary so for some unknown reason they made Mary the oldest of the sisters. It makes no sense, I know. It's like the BBC seemed to forget that these people actually lived. They're twisting the story around and making things up left and right. I feel ridiculous having to correct the BBC on historical inaccuracies, but REALLY! <br /><br />Apart from the two sisters the rest of the cast was actually very well chosen. Steven Mackintosh struck me as a brilliant choice for George, and his casting was the real reason I decided to seek out this movie. Big mistake. He does a great job, sure, but he's hardly in this. How can anyone pretend they're adapting The Other Boleyn Girl and hardly mention George Boleyn? That's just absurd. Philip Glenister was another very good casting decision, but yet again, was hardly in the finished product. <br /><br />The real problem with this is the script. There's just no getting around that. It's bad. It's really, really bad. It's too melodramatic and not engaging. Anne is portrayed as an air-head, Mary as the ringleader, and George as the follower.

The whole thing comes across as a great big waste. I have no desire to see this thing a second time.

"OLIVER TWIST was to have controversy as well as success following it after Dickens published it in 1837. His picture of life in the urban ghettos was something shocking and new, and his making the central figures of the novel include criminals was another innovation.<br /><br />One day he was walking in London and passed a young woman he had been friendly with. He said hello, but she was rather stiff with him. He could not understand this. A few days later they met again, and he asked what he had done to upset her. ""Well, if you must know, I did not like your last novel."", she said. ""Really, everyone else thinks highly of it."" He was puzzled: ""What's wrong with it?"" ""Oh, Charles,"" she said, ""I'm Jewish. How could you make up such a character like Fagin?!"" He had not expected this: ""Well...you know that trial last year of Ikey Solomon, the thief trainer. He's a model for Fagin and he was Jewish."" <br /><br />Dickens found that did not settle things. ""Yes,"" she replied, ""He got what he deserved. But Charles, they did not call him ""Solomon the Jew"" like you call Fagin ""the Jew""! Moreover, Solomon did not plan a murder. Fagin does."" Dickens had to admit that he might have gotten carried away. He left thinking about what she said.<br /><br />Oliver Twist was published in several editions. Dickens tried to improve on Fagin a bit. Then he got an idea. He reworked the chapter called ""Fagin's Last Night Alive"", showing the fears in the man as he faced hanging. He also added some additional details. <br /><br />He let his female friend know about his resolve to change Fagin. A day or so later he met her at a friend's house. She looked at him as though he was crazy. ""Didn't you like the changes?"", he asked. ""Charles, what changes - he's still a vile villain called ""the Jew""!"", she replied. ""Yes, I did keep those in, but didn't you see how frightened he was in the death cell in prison."" The young woman had noticed this, but felt that he was so vile he deserved to be suffering such fears. ""Ah...then I was right about that...and did you see the little details I added?"", he asked. ""What details?"", she replied. ""When you first see Fagin now he is cooking himself dinner...you read that?"", Dickens looked at her expecting a sign of recognition. Instead the lady looked confused. ""I read he was at the fireplace, but I must have skimmed the passage."" Dickens smiled as though he was brilliant, ""He is cooking a pork sausage for his dinner."" ""A what!""she exclaimed. ""He's eating pork, my dear...see - he's not a good Jew!"" His friend looked at him, shook her head, and to his dismay left their friend's house. She didn't speak to him for years.<br /><br />Dickens never totally shook off his own bigotries, but the situation did lead to a partial attempt at amends in his last completed novel. In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND (1865) he has a minor character, Mr. Riah, who is used by an unscrupulous landlord to collect high rents from poor tenants. The landlord figures that Mr. Riah will be blamed because he is Jewish.<br /><br />But Mr. Riah is a good man. He is a very good man. He is a very, very, very, very good man - so good as to be unbelievable. If Fagin saw Mr. Riah in action he'd probably chase him away with a stick.<br /><br />The anti-Semitic image of Fagin lingers to this day. It is a measure of Dickens' genius as a writer that the novel overcomes it. However, in presenting the story on film it still causes problems for screenplay writers and directors: how, after the Holocaust, can one do a film treatment of a worthy novel without inflaming bigotry? David Lean showed how by having Alec Guiness appear in one or two scenes showing a human side and in confronting a mob at the end with true dignity. Sir Carol Reed, in his musical version of the novel did it better yet, due to a rewrite in the original musical's script.<br /><br />OLIVER had been made into a West End musical hit in the middle 1960s, and then taken to Broadway where it was again a hit. With a wonderful score by Lionel Bart, including ""Food Glorious Food"", ""I Am Reviewing the Situation"", ""Consider Yourself"", ""Boy For Sale"", ""Who Will Buy"", ""As Long As He Needs Me"", it deserved it's success. Reed did well in his casting the roles, including his nephew Oliver Reed as Sykes, Ron Moody as Fagin, Mark Lester as Oliver, Jack Wild as the Dodger, Shani Wallis as Nancy, and Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble. There had been no big musical successes in Hollywood for a decade - the last musical to win the Best Picture Oscar had been GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968.<br /><br />And Fagin - how to handle the eternal problem of the caricature? Well in the musical Fagin is not captured, tried and executed for the murder that is committed. After all, even Lean showed Fagin tried to control his confederate in his actions. But here Fagin realizes that he is getting too old to depend on this kind of chancy life. Although he loses his treasures (those stolen items he kept because he knew their value, and admired their beauty), he decides he can reform. He is allowed to do so, accompanied by his faithful acolyte, the Artful Dodger. I don't think Dickens would have appreciated the change (his female friend might have), but a modern audience certainly accepts it as fitting.",1,5273,True,14473,"OLIVER TWIST sparked controversy and success after its 1837 publication. Dickens' depiction of urban ghettos and criminals was groundbreaking. One day, he encountered a Jewish female friend who criticized his portrayal of Fagin. Dickens explained Fagin was inspired by Ikey Solomon, a Jewish thief. She countered that Solomon wasn't labeled ""the Jew,"" nor did he plan murder. Dickens reconsidered and revised the ""Fagin's Last Night Alive"" chapter to humanize him. He added a detail of Fagin cooking pork, implying he wasn't a good Jew. His friend was unimpressed, and they parted ways for years.

Dickens' biases lingered, but he partially redeemed himself with Mr. Riah in OUR MUTUAL FRIEND (1865), a good Jewish character. Nonetheless, Fagin's anti-Semitic image persists. Dickens' genius helps the novel endure, but film adaptations face challenges post-Holocaust. David Lean and Sir Carol Reed addressed this in their adaptations. Reed's 1968 musical OLIVER, based on a successful West End show, won the Best Picture Oscar. It featured a stellar cast and altered Fagin's fate, allowing him to reform. While Dickens might not approve, modern audiences find it fitting."

The storyline gets lost before the middle, the characters are forgettable and the kid is such a non-talent that all he does is pose for the camera. An alien planet they land on is actually the Naval stockyards in Long Beach, California. 

The plot, if you can even call it that, meanders aimlessly, leaving viewers confused and disinterested. Any attempt at character development is completely absent, making it impossible to care about what happens to them. The kid, who seems to be the central figure in this mess, lacks any charisma or acting ability, reducing his performance to little more than posing awkwardly in front of the camera. It's painfully obvious that he's out of his depth, and it's baffling that he was cast in the first place.

Adding to the disappointment is the setting of the alien planet, which is laughably depicted as the Naval stockyards in Long Beach, California. The lack of creativity and effort in creating a believable alien world is staggering. It's as if the filmmakers didn't even bother to try, assuming the audience wouldn't notice or care. This lack of attention to detail further illustrates the laziness that permeates the entire production.

Watching this movie actually made me physically ill. The combination of poor storytelling, forgettable characters, and lackluster settings created an experience that was truly unpleasant. It's hard to imagine how anyone involved thought this was a worthwhile project. 

Roger Corman has made some good, some bad movies in his career, but there's no excuse for this one. His involvement in this travesty is disappointing, especially considering his reputation for producing entertaining low-budget films. This particular effort falls far short of even the lowest expectations.

"After viewing the film, I was truly shocked to see such a high rating on IMDb.<br /><br />'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' is an adaption of a beloved children's classic, portraying the story of the smooth, slick protagonist Mr. Fox (or 'Foxy') as he attempts one 'last' heist to steal from the dreaded Boggins, Bunce and Bean. That's right, one short, one fat, one lean, or however it goes.<br /><br />I don't quite know where to start with my criticism.<br /><br />Well, I'm in my late teens and was never a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his material well enough, having read a few of his books as a child and seen Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory over and over again. This film, however, struggles for an audience. Is it aimed at children? Adults? I'm still unsure! Many of the 'jokes' would bore a child, especially as Mr. Fox visits a lawyer for example, or complains about being poor.

'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' is an adaptation of a beloved children's classic, portraying the story of the smooth, slick protagonist Mr. Fox as he attempts one 'last' heist to steal from the dreaded Boggins, Bunce, and Bean. That's right, one short, one fat, one lean, or however it goes.

I don't quite know where to start with my criticism.

Well, I'm in my late teens and was never a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his material well enough, having read a few of his books as a child and seen Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory over and over again. This film, however, struggles for an audience. Is it aimed at children? Adults? I'm still unsure! Many of the 'jokes' would bore a child, especially as Mr. Fox visits a lawyer for example, or complains about being poor. Also, an audience of (I'm assuming) children is expected to sympathize with a character who steals and kills chickens. I'm all for the food chain, but you practically see Mr. Fox biting down on their necks! Surely that's a bit much? And also, the plot... well, it's kind of boring.

The film provides a relentless ride through a series of explosive set pieces and adrenaline-pumping scenes, where logic takes a backseat to spectacle. The formulaic plot is something you can see coming from a mile away, with its predictable twists and turns that have been done countless times before. Yet, there's an undeniable charm in its simplicity and dedication to delivering non-stop action. The protagonist is larger than life, embodying the classic hero archetype with unwavering determination and a knack for survival against all odds. His journey is peppered with moments that are both absurd and entertaining, pushing the boundaries of believability while keeping viewers engaged. The supporting characters, including the obligatory female presence, add layers to the narrative, though their roles often fall into familiar tropes. Despite its shortcomings, the movie's commitment to its genre is commendable, offering a straightforward, no-nonsense approach to storytelling that appeals to fans of action-packed cinema. The film doesn’t pretend to be anything other than what it is—a thrill ride designed to entertain with its over-the-top scenarios and gravity-defying stunts."
"This is an extremely dense, somber, and complicated film that unravels quite slowly, revealing excruciating detail, like the attention paid in a novel, and watching this film ""IS"" like watching a novel unfold.

The actors seemed completely disconnected from the material, as if they were reading the script for the first time during filming. Their lack of chemistry and conviction was almost impressive in its own right, creating an atmosphere that was awkward and uncomfortable to watch. Each line delivery was worse than the last, as if the cast was in a competition to see who could be the least convincing.

Second, the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin, and that is sorely lacking in this flick. We don't even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff. This was a surprising oversight, considering the genre often relies on such elements to maintain viewer interest. The film teased and hinted at what could have been, but ultimately failed to deliver, leaving viewers feeling unsatisfied and cheated. The lack of any real visual appeal or daring scenes added to the frustration, making the entire experience feel like a waste of time and potential. 

Ahh well, better luck next time, eh? It's always a gamble with these types of films, but the hope is that future endeavors in this genre will learn from the mistakes of this particular disaster. With so many areas needing improvement, there's certainly a lot of room for growth. Hopefully, others will take note and strive to create something that respects the audience's time and expectations."

Dead Line certainly fits the bill, offering an experience that is both captivating and chilling. From the moment the film begins, it grips you with its intensity, drawing you into a world of suspense and intrigue. 

A little warning, however: if you are going to watch this film, you are better off not knowing too many specifics about the plot. The filmmakers have crafted a story that thrives on mystery and unexpected turns, and going in with little knowledge enhances the overall experience. The less you know, the more you'll find yourself at the edge of your seat, eagerly anticipating each twist and turn.

As the movie progresses, the plot thickens and draws you deeper into its web. It is a really remarkably well-built tension that mounts scene by scene, leaving you both captivated and anxious about what will happen next. The filmmakers have masterfully woven together a narrative that keeps you guessing, and it's this unpredictability that makes the film so compelling.

It is deep and horrifying, exploring themes that are not only thrilling but also psychologically profound. The film goes all the way to the darkest places in the human mind, challenging viewers to confront fears and emotions that are often left untouched. It's a chilling exploration of the depths of human nature, and it leaves a lasting impression long after the credits roll.

The plot also has some very surprising shifts that catch you off guard and keep you engaged. Just when you think you have it all figured out, the story takes a new direction, keeping you on your toes and invested in the outcome. These shifts are not only surprising but also cleverly executed, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.

For the best experience, just wait till nightfall, turn off the light, and watch this film. The darkness of your surroundings will amplify the suspense, and the film's eerie atmosphere will envelop you completely. It's a movie that demands your full attention and rewards you with a thrilling, unforgettable journey into the unknown."

The introduction sets the stage with fascinating theories and evidence that challenge the traditional narratives surrounding Jesus. Sadly, though, after priming us with this, the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non-stop attack on Christianity, and pretty much focusing on the easy targets. The transition feels abrupt, leaving the viewer longing for more exploration of the initial premise rather than a barrage of criticism aimed at religious institutions.

The writer/director clearly has some issues with the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger) and this film seems to be his form of release. His personal experiences and frustrations with the Church are palpable, and they permeate much of the documentary's content. However, this shift in focus from the intriguing exploration of historical myths to a critique of Christianity's flaws significantly detracts from the film's potential impact. It'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, delving deeper into the historical evidence and scholarly debates surrounding the existence of Jesus. Such an expansion could provide a more balanced and informative perspective. But as a whole, the movie is disappointing. The initial promise of an insightful exploration into the mythologizing of Jesus is overshadowed by the director's personal grievances, leaving viewers feeling as though they have only scratched the surface of a much larger and more complex conversation."

"If the redundancy of getting off the boat, on the boat, off the bus, on the bus.. is a way to waste time then you should go back to the Hollywood films that wrap this part up in one montage in order to get to the money shots. and in doing so leave you unconnected and in the cinematic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life.

Sad, but worth it.",1,657,False,15073,"If the redundancy of getting off the boat, on the boat, off the bus, on the bus, and so on, is a way to waste time, then you should go back to the Hollywood films that wrap this part up in one convenient montage in order to get to the money shots. This approach can often leave you feeling unconnected and in the cinematic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life. The long, drawn-out travel sequences actually allow the viewer to experience the same frustration and 'wait-in-line' feeling that the characters must endure. Is it frustrating? Yes. Is it vital? Indeed. The limbo of that travel is absolutely the key to understanding the 'rootlessness' of this Turkish family. This is a beautiful film with great acting. It's sad, but it's worth it. The way the film captures the essence of these moments, the in-between spaces, is essential to the storytelling. It immerses the audience in the characters' journey, making you feel every tedious step, every moment of uncertainty. This sense of limbo is not just a narrative choice but a thematic one, reflecting the underlying feeling of displacement and uncertainty experienced by the family. The film's ability to evoke such emotions through these sequences is a testament to its craftsmanship. While it may test your patience, it ultimately enriches your understanding of the characters' experiences. The beauty of this film lies not just in its visual or dramatic moments but in its commitment to portraying the unvarnished truth of its characters' lives. It is a poignant reminder that sometimes the journey itself, with all its frustrations and delays, is as significant as the destination."
"My interpretation is that the term 'distant' is used in the sense of the opposite of 'warm'; people who are not warm toward others. The film reminds me of the teachings of the Dalai Lama in 'The Art of Happiness' where his main point is that the key to happiness is connecting with others. Not only are the characters in the film insular, but they are also humorless, charmless, shy, quiet and unfriendly. These characteristics appear to prevent them, amongst other things, from forming and enjoying relationships and being able to talk about and deal with their problems. And as a result they are terribly unhappy. I see it as a strong vindication of the Dalai Lama's teaching (I'm not a Buddist by the way). If you are one of the people who thinks that their behavior is a natural response to living in a large city then I think you may be right but I recommend the Dalai Lama's book. City life need not be like this.<br /><br />I can see why some people found it boring - it does drag a bit in places and the characters are not particularly likable. And it does contrast to Lost In Translation where the insular characters are much more likable and do connect with one another even though they don't connect with people generally.",1,1233,True,48705,"The term 'distant' in the film refers to people who are not warm toward others.

"Disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. Films like ""Tarzan"" and ""The Emperor's New Groove"" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. ""Atlantis"" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: This is STILL Disney. The first ever serious film to come out of Disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into PG territory. Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.<br /><br />But despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of ""The Little Mermaid"" et al.<br /><br />So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action film about Atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. Suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point A to point B so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron's ""Titanic"". Both films feature a boat in some manner.<br /><br />And let's talk about love, shall we? Yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one Milo Thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (Kida, the clichéd Atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clichéd as I was expecting. By film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. There's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, ""The Little Mermaid"" (A good thing).<br /><br />You may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film. Correct. You have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. It doesn't take a genius to do the maths  a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. So what does it rely on? Clichés, and lots of them. Every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale  need I go on?<br /><br />I don't know why this got to anyone  I found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. Alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect Disney to give up every single trait of their history? At least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.<br /><br />But in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. The CGI animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent ""Titan A.E."" down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous Disney outing. This resulted in a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, ""Nadia"", for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series. Having not seen this anime, I can't comment.<br /><br />With picture, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.<br /><br />Perhaps I missed the point of what the creators intended. To me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film before it. If you don't like the clichéd tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. Heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (*cough*Hercules*cough*).<br /><br />This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film  after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.",1,5188,True,18785,"Disney, once synonymous with innocence and all-ages content, is evolving to embrace diversity. Recent films like ""Tarzan"" and ""The Emperor's New Groove"" have shifted away from Disney's traditional song-driven formula. ""Atlantis"" marks their boldest step yet, venturing into PG territory with more mature themes, which may have deterred some families this past summer.

Despite its mature content, ""Atlantis"" still aims to attract families. The plot is kept simple enough for children yet engaging for older audiences, compressed into a 96-minute action film. It's less about exposition and more about the adventure, reminiscent of James Cameron's ""Titanic"" in its ambition, though both feature a boat.

The film includes a romance between Milo Thatch, a bumbling archaeologist, and Kida, the Atlantian princess, but it's more subdued than expected, unlike ""The Little Mermaid."" The film is clichéd, with archetypal characters like the bumbling scientist and the attractive princess, but it's amusingly tongue-in-cheek. Disney hasn't abandoned its history entirely, and the witty dialogue occasionally shines.

The visuals are the film's standout feature, with impressive CGI animation and character designs by an outside comic artist, lending an anime style. This sparked conflict with fans of the anime ""Nadia"" due to similarities. The sound, led by Gary Rydstrom, is exceptional, and James Newton Howard's score enhances the film's tension and mood.

""Atlantis"" is an adventure thrill ride with a serious tone, unlike any previous Disney film. If clichés don't appeal to you, the visuals might. The mythology is more accurate than in other Disney films (*cough*Hercules*cough*). This review is a positive 10 out of 10 from someone captivated by the film. Animated films often defy real-world laws, so sit back, enjoy, and find something to appreciate in ""Atlantis."""

"I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn't terribly motivating, and didn't even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like, so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one.

This missed opportunity is frustrating, especially considering the potential for a more nuanced portrayal of Puerto Rican culture and experiences. Sadly, what we are left with is a superficial and disappointing piece that does no justice to its subjects or its audience.

"There are few films that leave me with the feeling that Gregor Jordan's 'Ned Kelly' film did. Initially I had heard only half hearted recommendations, and decided to see it for myself. Since then, I have acquired both the video and soundtrack, and have to say that after several viewings, I am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film. It is also wonderful to see something Australian! I appreciate its down to earth quality, that if you ask me is a rarity, as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films. This film proves that you don't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point. The cast was a bonus, including a variety of well known, and might I add, good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters. It is interesting to note, that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what, and how they only said so many lines. However, if any criticism is due, it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded. In reality, these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in Australian history. For example, on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much, much more to the relationship between Joe Byrne and Aaron Sheritt, and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film. Also overlooked was the fact that it was not only Aaron Sheritt's efforts alone, that provided the Victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery. Yes, this is their interpretation of the story, and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention. I feel that in this case, this is the only limitation. However, I can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation. It certainly inspired me to look more closely. So, watch it and decide for yourself. You might not like it at all, thats your opinion, and thats fine.

"I did not enjoy the film Eraser whatsoever. It's awful acting, boring storyline and average special effects made this an annoying arnie film, as it had a mountain of potential. With other action films of the time Eraser fell very short!!!",0,238,False,28347,"I did not enjoy the film Eraser whatsoever. The acting in this movie was just awful, making it difficult to connect with any of the characters or become invested in their journeys. It was quite a letdown, especially considering the potential the film had to be something much more engaging and entertaining. The storyline was incredibly boring, lacking any real excitement or twists to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. It felt like it dragged on without any real purpose or direction, making it hard to stay interested throughout the entire movie.

Additionally, the special effects were just average, not living up to the standards set by other films of the time. In an era where action films were pushing the boundaries of what was possible with visual effects, Eraser fell remarkably short. The effects didn't add any real value to the film or enhance the experience in any significant way. This was particularly disappointing because special effects can often elevate an action film, making it more thrilling and captivating.

Overall, Eraser was an annoying Arnie film, as it had a mountain of potential that it just didn't live up to. With other action films of the time setting the bar high in terms of storytelling, acting, and special effects, Eraser fell very short in comparison. It was a missed opportunity to create something memorable and exciting, and instead, it ended up being a forgettable and unenjoyable experience."
"Best Years of Our Lives is a film that slipped under my radar for years--I had heard about it, but never had the opportunity to watch it.

The film frankly deals with the people who were wounded in the war, both physically and mentally. It manages neatly to encompass nearly all the varieties of war experience within three characters.<br /><br />We have the Air Force officer, who was a veteran of the early European bombing campaign. Because of the horrific attrition rate amongst the crews of the bombers, the Air Force at that time had a reputation for cranking out officers who quickly rose through the ranks.

From the stripes on his sleeve it is clear that he is the highest level of Sergeant, yet he is still on the front line.<br /><br />Finally we have the Navy Seaman, who is part of the faceless support staff, commonly referred to as REMFs (Rear Echelon MFers)by the fellows on the line. Ironically, he suffers the worst physical wounds when working as a mechanic below decks on a Navy ship, his ship is struck, presumably by a kamikaze and is sunk with loss of 400 lives. He is pulled from the water but his badly burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks.<br /><br />BYOOL tells the story of how these three meet on a transport plane they have boarded for home, and how they readjust into civilian society.<br /><br />What impressed me most about this film is that despite the obvious issues that face the three protagonists, it never descends into melodrama. The Navy kid, played by an actual amputee, is placed into situations where we might feel sorry for him, yet the script never lets us feel that emotion. The Army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and the story points that out, but never dwells on it. The Air Force captain struggles with the loss of status when he is forced to return to the drug store he soda jerked in (now bought out by a large chain) and take a demeaning job to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife.<br /><br />The script allows plenty of opportunities for all these characters to come to some dramatic climax regarding their plights, but it neatly avoids that. But for the overly dramatic score, the director has tread around exploiting the obvious.<br /><br />In one scene that well represents the entire movie, the daughter of the Army sergeant (Frederic March) is having a discussion with her father and mother regarding the Air Force captain. Despite his marriage, they have fallen in love, and she is determined to break up the marriage which is obviously troubled. Now we've seen thousands of scenes typical of this where the father blusters angrily and the daughter ends up running away to her room in tears, slamming the door and falling on the bed. Later, Mom shows up, consoles daughter and offers words of motherly wisdom, and everybody lives happily ever after.<br /><br />In BYOOL, this scene plays out completely differently than the cliché I have described above. Sure the conversation gets heated, but all parties are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialog I have seen.<br /><br />Ultimately, BYOOL is a highly satisfying film, with honest performances from the entire cast.

BYOOL tells the story of how these three meet on a transport plane they have boarded for home, and how they readjust into civilian society.

What impressed me most about this film is that despite the obvious issues that face the three protagonists, it never descends into melodrama. The Navy kid, played by an actual amputee, is placed into situations where we might feel sorry for him, yet the script never lets us feel that emotion. The Army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and the story points that out, but never dwells on it. The Air Force captain struggles with the loss of status when he is forced to return to the drug store he soda jerked in (now bought out by a large chain) and take a demeaning job to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife.

The script allows plenty of opportunities for all these characters to come to some dramatic climax regarding their plights, but it neatly avoids that. But for the overly dramatic score, the director has tread around exploiting the obvious.

In one scene that well represents the entire movie, the daughter of the Army sergeant (Frederic March) is having a discussion with her father and mother regarding the Air Force captain. Despite his marriage, they have fallen in love, and she is determined to break up the marriage which is obviously troubled. Now we've seen thousands of scenes typical of this where the father blusters angrily and the daughter ends up running away to her room in tears, slamming the door and falling on the bed. Later, Mom shows up, consoles daughter and offers words of motherly wisdom, and everybody lives happily ever after.

In BYOOL, this scene plays out completely differently than the cliché I have described above. Sure the conversation gets heated, but all parties are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialog I have seen.

Ultimately, BYOOL is a highly satisfying film, with honest performances from the entire cast. Technically, it is well shot, the editing and cinematography frame, but never overshadow the gripping narrative. Despite the score, which is cliché and over-dramatic, I give this film the highest rating that it clearly deserves."
"They're showing this on some off-network. It's well crap. While it is not as bad as the B-movies they show on the Sci-fi network on Saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap. The acting is passable. The plot and writing are fairly sub-standard and the pacing is entirely too slow. Every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they're wrapping things up before the credits - not the peak of the movie, the denouement. Also, large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range they're playing. The whole thing is predictable, boring and not worthy of being watched. Save your time. It's not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free.",0,674,False,5872,"They're showing this on some off-network channel, and honestly, it's well crap. While it is not quite as bad as the B-movies they tend to show on the Sci-fi network on Saturdays, it still manages to be a fairly large pile of crap. The acting, I must admit, is passable, though that’s not saying much. The plot and writing, on the other hand, are fairly sub-standard, leaving much to be desired. The pacing, unfortunately, is entirely too slow, dragging the entire experience down. Every single minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they're wrapping things up before the credits roll - it’s not the peak of the movie, not the climax, but rather the denouement. It’s as if you’re stuck in a perpetual ending without the satisfaction of a proper build-up or conclusion. To add to the woes, large portions of the cast look way too old for the age range they're playing, which only breaks the immersion even further. The whole thing is predictable, and boring, and ultimately not worthy of being watched. It’s a waste of time, plain and simple. Save your time and skip this one. It's not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free, and that’s saying something. There are far better ways to spend your precious time than subjecting yourself to this lackluster piece of filmmaking."
"After I saw ""La Pianiste"" several years ago, I said to myself that I would never see it again, so powerful and disturbing it was. Time went on but I could not get the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut out of my mind. The story of a respected Piano teacher in Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing. I read the book ""The Piano Teacher"" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel Prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it I saw the film again. Second time, all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. Not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as ""Le Pianiste"". Three actors gave outstanding performances. Franz Schubert's Piano music, ""soaked in the morbid humanity"", is another bright star of the movie.<br /><br />I only have one problem with Haneke's vision. There is a scene in the film where Haneke made some changes to Erika's character comparing to the novel. In the book, the furthest she went to reveal herself to Walter, the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her, was in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika of the book would never chase Walter to throw herself to him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to act, she was not a chaser - she loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. It tried to make Erika sympathetic (and of course, Huppert was heartbreaking) but it took the mystery that surrounded her - Jelinek did not write that scene, it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film.",1,1894,True,48243,"After I saw ""La Pianiste"" several years ago, I vowed never to watch it again due to its powerful and disturbing nature.

I have one issue with Haneke's vision. In the film, Haneke alters Erika's character compared to the novel. In the book, Erika only reveals herself to Walter, a young conservatory student attracted to her, through a letter. Once he showed repulsion, she ceased communication. Book-Erika wouldn’t chase Walter or throw herself at him; she was an observer, not a chaser. The big scene during the hockey game was unnecessary. It attempted to make Erika sympathetic (and Huppert was heartbreaking), but it diminished the mystery surrounding her. Jelinek didn't write that scene, and it felt false in an otherwise excellent film."
"This movie is not so good as I thought it would be. There is no story whatsoever, no characters and some dialog would have been nice. The gore effects are good and it gets quite bloody at times but nothing over the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when that is over the scene with the girl starts. The music is a classic score and fits the movie very well. They should have made a 90 minutes version in which they could have had some time for character development so we can feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table. And some more info about the morticians would have made this movie far scarier than it is.

The movie tries to captivate its audience with its visual effects, but unfortunately, it falls short in other critical areas. The lack of a coherent story leaves viewers wanting more substance and depth. Characters are non-existent, which makes it hard to connect with the narrative or feel any sense of empathy for the individuals on screen. Some dialog would have been a nice addition to provide context and drive the plot forward. The gore effects, while good, do not make up for the lack of storytelling. The film does get quite bloody at times, but nothing over the top or shocking enough to compensate for the absence of a compelling plot. It begins with an autopsy on a man, which initially seems intriguing, but quickly loses its impact as the movie progresses into a scene with a girl. The music, a classic score, fits the movie very well and adds some atmosphere to the scenes. However, it is not enough to save the film from its shortcomings. They should have considered making a 90 minutes version, allowing more time for character development and providing viewers an opportunity to feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table. Additionally, more information about the morticians could have added layers to the story, making this movie far scarier than it is. Overall, don't expect a scary movie but rather a nice, gory special effects reel that lacks substance and fails to deliver a memorable experience."

It’s a film that brings together a mix of elements that, on paper, might seem like they would work well together, yet in execution, they fall short of delivering a satisfying cinematic experience. Just bought the movie for a buck, and it is worth it, but not much more. It finds itself in that peculiar category of movies that don’t quite live up to the promise of their components, making it a curiosity more than a classic. Good to see Mark Hamill act again, as his presence is always a welcome one, bringing a familiar face to a film that struggles to find its footing. There should be a decent sequel made to remedy the damage from the original. Such a sequel could potentially address the issues that hold the original back and explore the intriguing concepts with the depth and attention they deserve. Or at least give it the proper attention it should have received in the first place, allowing it to shine with the polish and care that could have elevated it beyond its current state.

Berstein's score gave demanded your attention from the opening credits, however, the long shots of slipstream planes and the even longer revealing of interesting plot points mutes his attention getting score. The music serves as a highlight, a beacon of what could have been a more cohesive and engaging experience had the other elements matched its quality. It is really easy to dog a movie like this, after all it is by the producer of STARWARS and the director of TRON and a tremendous cast but it is what it is. With such a pedigree, expectations naturally ran high, and the final product feels all the more disappointing because of it. And that ain't much. The film is a testament to the idea that even with all the right pieces, the puzzle can still come together in a way that is less than the sum of its parts. Favorite Line- ""We're going to make it, ha-ha!...(BOOM!)"" This moment encapsulates the film’s unintentional humor and its knack for undermining its own tension, a fitting summary of the ride that is Slipstream."
"There were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this film certainly isn't one of them! It's a shame The Child isn't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. The plot is basically this: young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge (as you do). This is all well and good, except for the fact that it's boring! Nothing happens for most of the film, and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore; it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it. The film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. There's really not much I can say about the film overall as there isn't much to it. The Child is a dismal seventies horror flick and I certainly don't recommend it.",0,1127,True,12292,"The Child isn't a great horror film from the seventies, despite having a decent idea with themes of a vengeful child and zombies.

It's the kind of film that doesn't necessarily push the boundaries of cinema but excels in delivering pure entertainment. Funny, fresh, intelligent - these are qualities that seem to be rare in the current cinematic landscape, yet this movie manages to embody them effortlessly. There are still people out there who don't need millions of dollars to hide that they're out of ideas. It's refreshing to see filmmakers who rely on creativity, clever writing, and genuine passion for storytelling to craft a film that resonates with audiences. In a world saturated with big-budget blockbusters that often prioritize spectacle over substance, this movie stands out as a testament to what can be achieved with a modest budget and a lot of heart.

When you compare this to your average Hollywood action flick, you're comparing a homemade meal with a Big Mac. The homemade meal represents something crafted with care, attention to detail, and a personal touch that mass-produced fast food simply can't replicate. Similarly, this movie offers a level of charm and authenticity that many high-octane productions lack. It's the kind of film that reminds you why you fell in love with movies in the first place, offering a delightful escape from the predictable formulas that dominate mainstream cinema. So, if you're looking for a film that's not just another cog in the Hollywood machine, this is definitely worth a watch."
"JUST CAUSE is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative (though exceedingly predictable) writing. Sean Connery is an anti-death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man (Blair Underwood) from the ultimate penalty. To set things right, Connery ventures to the scene of the crime, where he must contend not only with the passage of time, but a meddling sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Twists and turns and role reversals abound -- some surprising, some not -- as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery. The climactic ending is a bit ludicrous, but JUST CAUSE is worth a look on a slow night.",1,670,False,13664,"JUST CAUSE is a flawed but decent film that is held together by strong performances and some creative (though exceedingly predictable) writing. Sean Connery, in one of his later roles, takes on the character of an anti-death penalty crusader who is brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man, played by Blair Underwood, from the ultimate penalty that the justice system can impose. This sets the stage for a compelling narrative where Connery's character must venture to the scene of the crime. There, he faces not only the challenges brought on by the passage of time but also the interference of a meddling sheriff, portrayed by Laurence Fishburne. 

The plot is rich with twists and turns, as well as role reversals that keep the audience engaged. Some of these twists are genuinely surprising, adding depth and intrigue to the unfolding mystery, while others are more predictable, yet they contribute to the overall texture of the story. As the aging crusader works tirelessly to unravel the mystery at the heart of the case, viewers are taken on a journey through the complexities of justice and redemption. 

While the film's climactic ending might be viewed as a bit ludicrous by some, it does not detract significantly from the overall experience. Instead, it serves as a dramatic conclusion to a story that keeps audiences invested throughout. Despite its flaws, JUST CAUSE is certainly worth a look, especially on a slow night when you're in the mood for a film that combines strong performances with a narrative that, while not without its faults, delivers entertainment and a touch of suspense. The film's strengths lie in its ability to present a compelling story through the lens of its talented cast, making it a worthwhile watch for anyone interested in a crime drama with both heart and complexity."
