# paper-template
This is a template for writing a research paper in latex. The template includes directory structure and some latex helpers---style and macros.
 
When writing a paper with me, start by cloning this repo. Code for the project goes in /src, paper under /doc, talks and posters under /etc, and demo data under /data. Usually, *outputs* of code should not be tracked by git. Full datasets should not be uploaded on github unless they are small.
